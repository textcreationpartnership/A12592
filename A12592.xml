            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Wo ſortes of Recuſantes are in this land: the one Popiſh, the other Anabaptiſticall. They giue out, that wee haue no miniſtery, no Sacraments, no viſible Church. Theſe men labour of two diſeaſes: the one is great pride, the other groſſe ignorance. Their pride appeares in their behauiour, which is voide of humilitie: their ignorance in their Arguments, which hang together like a ſicke mans dreame. That her Maieſtie may and ought to compell theſe Recuſants to frequent our Church aſſemblies, I make no queſtion. There is an other ſorte, which either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or doubt, whether vnpreaching miniſters doe deliuer a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: vpon better aduiſe, ſome of them confeſſe, that ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant miniſters, doe adminiſter a Sacrament: but they adde this, that ſuch as receiue any Sacrament at their hands, doe ſinne groſſely and pollute the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſelues. I will hope well of theſe men: for they erre, onely for want of iudgement. The holy Sacrament is one thing, the miniſters ignorance is an other thing: the Lordes Sacrament brings ſinguler comfort to the worthie receiuer: the miniſters ignorance can neither per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uert the Sacrament, nor pollute the receiuer. The Donatiſtes taught otherwiſe in the former time, and the Anabaptiſtes in our time: but they are notably confuted by two famous men, Auguſtine and Caluine. What account I make of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant miniſters, appeareth in this treatiſe. It pleaſed God to direct my heart and penne in this holy labour: therefore I aſſure my ſelfe of his gracious bleſſing.</p>

                  <p>Great outrages were committed againſt both the tables of the commandements, as appeareth in the booke of Iudges: <hi>for, euery man did that whih was good in his owne eyes: Iudg. 17. &amp; 19. cha.</hi> The reaſon of theſe abſurdities is ſet out liuely and often in theſe words: <hi>There was no king in Iſrael.

                  </p>
                  <p>The Prince is bound to ſanctifie the Sabboth: ſo are his ſubiects: the Lords commaundement is flat for this: <hi>Remember the Sabboth day, to keepe it holy: Sixe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:18219:4"/>dayes ſhalt thou labour, and do all thy worke: But the ſeuenth day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy God, in it thou ſhalt not do any worke, thou, nor thy ſonne, nor thy daughter, thy man ſeruant, nor thy mayd, nor thy beaſt, nor thy ſtranger that is within thy gates, &amp;c. Exo. 20.</hi> If none are exempted by almightie God, none can be diſpenſed with by man, for all are charged to preſent themſelues in the holy aſſemblies. And, leaſt any, either prince or ſubiect, ſhould forget this duetie, the Lord himſelfe is their remembrancer in theſe wordes: <hi>Remember, that thou ſanctifie the Sabboth &amp;c.</hi> that is, the ſanctification of my Sabboth, is a matter very important, it concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth my honour, but thy comfort, therfore remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber and forget it not.

                  </p>
                  <p>Faith commeth by hearing of the word, <hi>Rom. 10.</hi> therefore refuſall to heare, hinders both the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and growth of faith.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He exerciſe of falſe religion is directly againſt the ſanctification of the Lords Sabboth: <hi>Exo. 20.</hi> therefore the Prince may not at any hande ſuffer it. The Morall lawe, as it teacheth the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of Almightie God in the firſt, and honeſtie of life in the ſecond table of the commandements, is perpetuall, and bindeth vs vnto the worldes ende.</p>
                  <p>The Iſraelites being in captiuitie in Egypt, were required by Pharao to ſacrifice to Almightie God in Egypt: Moſes refuſed &amp;c. <hi>Exod. 8.</hi> The Iſraelites being in captiuitie in Babylon were required by the Chaldeans to ſing one of the ſongs of Sion. They refuſed and anſwered thus: <hi>How ſhall we ſing the Lords ſong in a ſtrange land? Pſal. 137.</hi> Of theſe places I gather my argument thus: It was not lawfull to ſacrifice in Egypt, and to ſing the Lords ſong in <hi>Chaldea,</hi> which were polluted landes: therefore it is not lawfull to ſuffer Idolatrous &amp; popiſh ſeruice in Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d, which is a holy land. That profeſſed papiſts are Idolaters, it is manifeſt: firſt, they worſhip falſe gods: for they worſhip Angels and Saintes deceaſed which are no
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:18219:6"/>gods, Secondly, they worſhippe not the true God aright: for they doe not worſhip him according to his written worde.</p>
                  <p>Confeſſion &amp; conſent in the true religion, is <hi>Vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culum eccleſiae,</hi> the chaine and bond of Gods Church: for the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>there is but one faith. Ephe. 4.5.</hi> therefore diſſenſion and difference in religion is a diſſolutio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Gods Church. But no prince may haue any, either hand or litle finger in diſſoluting Gods Church: for Kings and Queenes are the nurſing fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers of the Church. <hi>Eſai. 4.9.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is the Princes duetie to prouide for the ſafetie of the bodies, therefore much more for the ſafety of the ſoules of his ſubiects. If for the ſafetie of their ſoules, then they may not ſuffer them to poyſon their ſoules. True religion is the foode of the ſoule. It is but one. To ſwarue from that, is the bane of the ſoule. It leadeth to hell. The Shipmaſter and ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard muſt keepe his ſhippe and ſheepe from rocke and wolfe. <hi>Qui non ſcruat ſi poteſt periturum, occidit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The prince is bounde to ſerue the Lord in feare. <hi>Pſal. 2.</hi> therefore he may not ſuffer almightie God to be diſhonoured by any of his ſubiects.

                  <p>A godly prince may not ſuffer a wilfull breach of his owne lawes: therefore not of Gods lawes. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mightie God is greater then all Princes. His lawes doe as farre paſſe the princes, as the gold of Ophir the clay in the ſtreet. Beſides, they which hate Gods religion, and conſequently ſinne againſt the firſt table, are eaſily induced to diſobey their prince, which is a ſinne againſt the ſecond table. It was a famous ſpeech of the Emperour <hi>Constantius</hi> the father of <hi>Conſtantinus</hi> the Emperour: <hi>Howe can they bee faſt and true to the Emperour, which are Traitours to Almightie God? Euſeb. lib. 1. de vita Conſtant. King Aſa depoſed Maachah his mother from her regencie, becauſe ſhe had made an idoll in agroue: Aſa brake downe her idoll, and ſtamped it, at the brooke Kidron. 2.

                  <p>Edward the ſixth, a Prince of famous memorie,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:18219:7"/>was dealt with by his honourable counſailours that the Lady Mary which ſucceeded in the kingdome, might haue popiſh maſſe &amp;c. Arguments were vſed to induce his Maieſtie to like of that courſe. His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere and reſolution was negatiue. So doth maſter Foxe report in the Actes and monuments in theſe wordes: In the dayes of King Edward the ſixth, <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolus</hi> the Emperour made requeſt to the ſayde King and his Counſell, to permit Lady Mary (who after ſucceeded in the crowne) to haue Maſſe in her houſe without preiudice of the Law. And the Counſel on a time ſitting vpon matters of policie, hauing that in queſtion, ſent Cranmer then Archbiſhop of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terburie, and Ridley then Biſhop of London, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treate the king for the ſame: who comming to his Grace, alledged their reaſons and perſwaſions for the accompliſhing thereof. So the King hearing what they could ſay, replied his anſwere againe out of the ſcriptures, ſo groundedly, grauely and fully, that they were enforced to giue place to his replica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and grant the ſame to be true. Then they, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter long debating in this maner with his Maieſtie, laboured politikely in an other ſort, and alledged what dangers the denying thereof might bring to his grace, what breach of amitie of the Emperours part, what troubles, what vnkindneſſe, and what oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions ſundry wayes it woulde enforce &amp;c. Vnto whome the king anſwered, willing them to content themſelues: for he would (he ſaide) ſpende his life and all he had, rather then to agree and graunt to that hee knewe certainely to bee againſt the trueth. The which when the Biſhops heard, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding they vrged him ſtill to graunt, and would by
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:18219:7"/>no meanes haue his nay. Then the good king ſeeing their importunate ſuite, that needes they woulde haue his Maieſtie to conſent thereto, in the ende his tender heart burſting out in bitter weeping, and ſobbing, deſired them to be content. Whereat the Biſhoppes themſelues, ſeeing the kings zeale and conſtancie, wept as faſt as he, and ſo tooke their leaue of his grace: and comming from him, the Archbiſhoppe tooke maſter Cheeke his Schoole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter by the hand and ſayde: Ah maſter Cheeke, you may be glad all the dayes of your life, that you haue ſuch a ſcholler, for he hath more diuinitie in his litle finger then all we haue in all our bodies &amp;c.

If the Gentiles had not bene firſt taught, they would not haue offered the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ſelues, nor the Apoſtles haue admitted them to the holy Sacrament of baptiſme. If any will conclude of this place in Saint Mathewe, that none whatſoeuer may bee admitted to baptiſme before they bee taught, they ſhut our infants from the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:18219:15"/>and therefore are Catabaptiſts.</p>
                  <p>The vnpreaching miniſters doe adde <hi>(verbum adificans)</hi> that is, an edifying worde, to the Elements in the adminiſtration of the holy ſupper, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>That there is <hi>verbum aedificans,</hi> I proue it thus.</p>
                  <p>The ſumme of Chriſtes ſermon in the Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on &amp; adminiſtration of the holy ſupper by himſelfe, is the word of Inſtitution in the adminiſtration of the holy Supper in the Church of England: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, vnleſſe we wil denie the ſumme of Chriſts Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, to be an edifying word, (which no learned ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> wil deny) we muſt confeſſe, that we haue <hi>verbum aedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficans</hi> in the adminiſtration of the holy ſupper with vs.</p>

                  <p>The argument followes not. My reaſon is, Many Iewiſh Prieſtes were both ignorant and diſſolute in Eſay and Chriſts time. <hi>Eſay 28. verſ. 7. Matth. 9. verſ. 36.</hi> But the Sacrifices offered, and the Sacraments reached by them, were both Sacrifices and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: otherwiſe, the Prophets which were at Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem, when the Iewiſh Church was full of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, woulde not haue bene preſent at, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the Sacrifices in Salomons Temple. <hi>Calu.

                  <p>Ignorant miniſters are not apt to teach: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no miniſters, and conſequently, they are no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments which are deliuered by them.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwere.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The argument followes not. I grant that it is of the ſubſtance of a lawful &amp; good miniſter of God to be apt to teach: but it is not of the eſſence of a Miniſter ſimply: for which it is ſufficient to haue the Churches calling. This appeareth clearely in the Magiſtrate. The holy Ghoſt requireth that none ſhoulde bee choſen a Magiſtrate, vnleſſe he were a man of courage, fearing God, dealing true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and hating couetouſneſſe. <hi>Exodus. 18. verſe 21.</hi> When ſuch are aduanced as defile their handes, either with filthie bribes, as <hi>Felix</hi> did, or with bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous crueltie, as <hi>Abimelech</hi> and <hi>Herode</hi> did, ſhall we ſay that they are no Magiſtrates? I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe, they are not ſingled out by the electors ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Almightie Gods direction in his holy Bible: but they are Magiſtrates notwithſtanding, and we are commanded by the Lord to perfourme all duetie vnto them, <hi>Saluo officio,</hi> that is, our due<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie being reſerued to the higheſt Magiſtrate, which is God himſelfe.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall gather of this I haue ſet downe, that I vndertake the defence of Ignorant miniſters: my anſwere is, that my writings and ſermons, are not Aiax ſhielde to couer them, but the Lords ſworde to cutte them. I confeſſe freely, that I am very farre from opening either the Church doore to igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Miniſters, or the Pulpit doore to vnſkilfull preachers: which vnſkilfull preachers giue Gods
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:18219:16"/>religion a greater blowe then the ignorant Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: for in ſteade of deuiding the worde of trueth aright, they ſpeake at al aduentures, yet very bolde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and as vnſkilfull Apothecaries, deliuer <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> chaffe for wheate, and ſtrange fancies for Gods holy trueth. By ſuch abſurde fellowes, many Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches and excellent men in this lande haue beene greatly diſquieted, and the good courſe of religion hath beene greatly hindered. The cauſe of this ſore, is intollerable pride, and groſſe ignorance in theſe bad companions, and want of care in the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates.</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall aske mee what the true cauſes are, why ſo many vnfitte men are the Churches Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: I anſwere, either great want of iudgement, or great corruption in ſuch, which doe ordeine and preferre them. The ſinne of theſe men is very great: for they diſhonour Almightie God, and do groſly abuſe the people of the land. This diſeaſe will bee healed, when the Churches maintenance is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of by them which haue the golden dropſie, but is freely giuen to worthie and painefull ſtudents, which will nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fiſh with the ſiluer hooke, nor open the Church doore with a ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer key.</p>

                  <p>Circumciſion was one of the Lords Sacraments in the Iewiſh Church.

Penry</hi> ſaith, that an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling is contained in the fufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie of gifts, and willingneſſe to practiſe them. <hi>pag. 45.</hi> If <hi>M.

                  <p>The Miniſters in England are not choſen by the Pariſhes ouer which they are ſet: therefore they are no miniſters, and conſequently there is no ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of the worde or Sacraments, no wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhippe of God, nor viſible Church in England, as ſome Anabaptiſts haue giuen out of late.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I denie the Argument. My reaſon is: if this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument of theirs were good, theſe abſurdities would follow. Firſt, that Gods Church is neceſſari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tyed in all places and times to one forme in the externall calling of the miniſters. Secondly, that the excellent aſſemblie in the Primitiue Church, <hi>Actes 2. verſe 41, 42.</hi> was not the Church of God: for at that time, the Miniſters were not elected by the Preſbitery &amp; people. Thirdly, that the worthieſt Preachers in this land, are no Miniſters. Laſtly, that very many parts of England are like to haue no tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, becauſe they are vtterly vnfit to make choiſe of their Paſtours. If it be ſaide that ſome Biſhops in
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:18219:21"/>ordeyning, and ſome Patrones in preſenting igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Miniſters, haue erred as groſly as any Pariſh can: my anſwere is, that I neither dare, nor will defend ſuch, either Biſhops or Patrons: I doe ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther exhort them to vnfeyned repentance: for this great ſinne of theirs hath, and doth crie very loude for ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table vengeance.</p>

                  <head>TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Did publiſh a ſhort Treatiſe in May laſt. It hath pleaſed one M. <hi>Penry</hi> to examine part of it, and (as an other <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi>) to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure it. His booke was ſent me. I haue viewed it, and doe finde ſtrange things in it. Aduiſe was giuen me, not to vouchſafe an anſwere, becauſe M. <hi>Penry</hi> is very ignorant, and his Treatiſe very ſillie and corrupt ſtuffe. I conſidered waightely of it, but reſolued to take ſome paines. The reaſons which induced me, are: First, S. <hi>Paul</hi> vouchſafed in Gods cauſe to deale with <hi>Deme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trius</hi> the ſiluer, and <hi>Alexander</hi> the copper ſmith. The Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zechiel</hi> in the like cauſe, did ſet himſelfe againſt certaine wicked women &amp;c. <hi>Ezech. 13.</hi> Secondly, many haue beene miſlead by his abſurd fancies. To cure theſe, if God will, and to ſtay other, my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour is not amiſſe. Lastly, I am perſonally both charged and cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenged by him: therefore it became me to take pen in hand. M. <hi>Penries</hi> booke is a fardle of groſſe errours. None accompt of it, but ſuch as are of the fantasticall crewe: men extremely both proude and ignorant. He hath as many learned men of his ſide, as H. N. the prince of the familie of Loue had of his: that is, neuer a one: therefore a little Arithmetique will ſerue to number them. If it had pleaſed him to haue conſidered of, and rested in the iudgement and direction of very famous men and Churches, he had not ſwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued from Gods booke, he had ſailed by a ſure compaſſe, he had not broched ſuch fancies, as Gods Church with one voyce condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth. <hi>Neſtorius</hi> was an abſurd heretike: he had ſome ſparkles of eloquence by nature: hee was in his owne opinion learned, but in deede very ignorant: his pride was ſuch, that he vouchſafed not to reade any interpreters. <hi>Socrat. lib. 7. cap. 32.</hi> I aſſure my ſelfe, that M. <hi>Penry</hi> is very farre from <hi>Neſtorius</hi> hereſie: I would he were as cleare ofpride and contempt of writers. <hi>Caluine, Beza, &amp;c.</hi> men of excellent learning, are caſt off by him, eue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> in thoſe waighty cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, wherein they ſhake hands with all the Churches of God. I doe not belie him, I charge him iustly: it ſhall appeare ſo by Gods grace in this Treatiſe. The queſtion betweene him and me, is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ignorant men may either enter into, or continue in the holy ministerie: for, my reſolution is negatiue, that is, that they ought
<pb facs="tcp:18219:24"/>not: but the queſtion is, whether ſuch as were and are baptized by Popiſh prieſts and ignorant miniſters, haue and doe receiue a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: and whether the godly communicant is polluted by recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacrament at the hands of vnpreaching miniſters. The moſt famous men and Churches, are peremptorie for me, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him. Yea, M. <hi>Penry</hi> himſelfe ioyneth with me in many partes of his Treatiſe: in ſome other partes, I confeſſe, he ſings an other ſong, abſurde for matter, and out of tune for manner. This inconstancie of his proceedes from a vaine humour, which as a whirle-winde, doeth ſtrangely carrie and ouer-carrie him. It is not in my handes to heale him: if it were, I woulde with all my heart. I will pray vnto God to cure him. <hi>Cathedram in coelo habet, qui corda docet.</hi> All that I deſire of the godly Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, is, that he wil reade my Treatiſe before he giue ſente<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, I may iuſtly charge him, to bring not <hi>iudicium,</hi> but <hi>praejudici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> that is, to be very partiall. Let him, in Gods Name, compare my arguments and anſweres with my aduerſaries, and weigh them in equall balance: if hee doeth not ſee clearely, and feele ſenſibly his groſſe errors &amp; Anabaptiſticall fancies, his eyes are dimme, his fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers are benummed. That he may haue preſent and ſpeedie viewe of the pearles in his booke, I haue ſet downe in a Table, diuers ſtrange particulers. If they ſeeme harſh and rough-hewen, blame <hi>M. Penry:</hi> for they come out of his forge. Yea, I dare be bolde to ſay, that if the Spiders webbe bee good cloth, and the Cockatrice egges holſome meate, then ſuch points as I refute in this Treatiſe, are very excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Diuinitie. I am not alone of this iudgement: the worthieſt Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines in this land iumpe with me, and do miſlike and condemne his abſurdities. It pleaſed God to aſſiſt mee graciouſly in the paines I haue taken: I thanke his Maieſtie very humbly for it: I doubt not, but that he will giue a bleſſing vnto it. The Lord giue vs grace to ſee and know our ignorance, to be truely humble, to grow in godly knowledge, and not in Anabapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical and blasphemous fancies. London. Septemb. 19. 1588.</p>

                     <hi>
                        <seg rend="decorInit">M</seg>aſter</hi> Penry <hi>ſaith, That the life of the Magiſtracie is neither preſcribed in the worde (for ſo there could be no Magiſtrates out of the Church, nor any in the Church, but ſuch as are preſcribed in the word, which were impious to thinke) nor conteined in the gifts of the Magiſtracie, nor yet ſeparated from his outwarde calling: For the very outward calling, is it that giueth life vnto the Magiſtracie, though the perſon ſuſtei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning it, want gifts to diſcharge the ſame. The reaſon hereof is euident, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Magiſtracie being an humaine conſtitution, as the holy Ghoſt ſaith 1. Pet. 2.13. is appropriated vnto his poſſeſſion, vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> whomſoeuer man beſtoweth the ſame, if hee be capable to poſſeſſe (though vnfit to execute) what is a lotted vnto him. In his addition page 48.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This ſpeach of <hi>M. Penryes</hi> is very groſse. His firſt reaſon is this: there may be Magiſtrates out of the Church, therefore the life of the Magistracie is not preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed in the word. <hi>M. P.</hi> Antecedent is true: For <hi>Pharao, Nero, Iulian</hi> were magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates out of the Church. I deny his argument: My reaſon is: the gifts of courage, fearing God, dealing truly, hating couetouſnes, which are the life of the Magiſtrate, are preſcribed in Gods booke, <hi>Exo. 18.21. Deu. 1.13.</hi> If you ſay they are not the life of the magiſtracie, you diſsent from all the learned, and therfore muſt ſet downe what God requireth of him, that ſhould be his Magiſtrate.</p>
                  <p>His ſecond reaſon is this: There are and may be magiſtrates within the Church, which are not garniſhed with the aboue named gifts: therefore the life of the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtracie is not preſcribed in the word. My anſwere is, I confeſse that abſurd Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates haue bene and are many times aduanced in the Church, (I graunt they ſhould not) either by the corruption or errour of the electours: But I deny your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: My reaſon is: It is great wickednes to thinke, becauſe groſſe Electours pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre vnfit men and ſo faile in their duetie, that Almightie God hath failed in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing what kinde of men he would haue to be his lieutenants.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry</hi> addeth, that the life of the Magiſtracie is not conteined in the gifts of the magiſtracie. I diſsent from him in this. If he had ſaid, that the birth of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie is not conteined in the gifts of the magiſtracie, he had hit the white.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry</hi> writeth that the life of the magiſtracie is not ſeparated from his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling: for the very outward calling, ſaith he, is it that giueth life vnto the magiſtracie. If this were true, then the life and birth of the magiſtrate are <hi>idem tempore,</hi> that is, twinnes: and conſequently whoſoeuer hath the outwarde calling which is the birth, hath the inwarde calling which is the life of the magiſtrate. So is Gods furniture tyed to the electours voices, as to the chaire, and the inward &amp; out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling of the magiſtrate confounded, which is a palpable errour. If there bee an outward calling to the magiſtracie, without the which no man (howſoeuer furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed within) may preſume to execute the office of the magiſtrate, I am ſure there is an inward calling to the magiſtracie: For the outwarde calling doeth import an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.
<pb facs="tcp:18219:26"/>If there be an inward calling which is by God himſelfe, what I beſeech you is it but ſuch furniture and gifts, as are preſcribed and required in the holy word?</p>
                  <p>The foundation whereupon <hi>M. Penry</hi> hath built his former abſurdities, is a very rotten poſt, that is, a groſse deprauing of a text of Scripture, viz. <hi>The Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracie is an humaine ordinance, 1. Pet. 2.13.</hi> that is, a deuiſe of man, and not an Eccleſiaſticall conſtitution preſcribed in the worde. That the magiſtracie is not any deuiſe of man, but Gods ordinance for the benefite of man, is a cleare trueth in Gods booke. None doubt of it, vnleſse they be Anabaptiſts or extremely ignorant.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry ſaith that the word barely read and to no other purpoſe then to edifie by reading, is not holſome doctrine. Chap. 8. pag. 99.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a blaſphemous abſurditie. <hi>M. Penryes</hi> reaſons for it are moſt abſurd and childiſh. I referre you to my anſwere. Chap. <hi>8.</hi> pag. <hi>100. 101.</hi> and to a propoſition which I haue handled. Chap. <hi>4.</hi> pag. <hi>62.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry writeth that it is falſe to ſay that the recitall of the ſumme of Chriſtes Sermon, that is, the word of inſtitution, &amp;c. is an edifying word: he ſaith it mainteyneth charming. Chap. 8. pag. 88. 89.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a blaſphemous abſurditie. If euery part of the Canonical Scripture doth edifie, I trust the ſumme of the Lord Ieſus Sermon ought to haue ſinguler allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.

                     <hi>M. Penry ſaith that the people cannot ſanctifie a Sabboth without a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. His words are theſe: They are no miniſters, whoſe flocks by their mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery can not ſanctifie the Sabboth: our Readers are ſuch, &amp;c.

                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry</hi> accounteth the publique reading of the holy Scripture and publique prayers, no part of the ſanctification of the Sabboth. If he had ſaid that the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>both is not ſo well ſanctified without, as with a godly Sermon, I woulde haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vnto him.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry maketh the perſon to giue credite to the holy word. His wordes are theſe: The word of God vttered, is not an edifying word, vnleſſe it be vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered according to the ordinance, both in regard of the perſons that vtter the ſame, and the ende wherefore it is vttered. Chap. 8. pag. 99.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a Popiſh errour: for the Scripture is <gap reason="foreign">

                     <hi>M. Penry ſaith that there is no Church at all in Popery. Chap. 23. pag. 175. 176.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a groſse errour, condemned of very famous men and all reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches. If there be no church at all in Popery, theſe abſurdities will followe: first, the Pope is not Antichriſt: Secondly, the infants of Papiſts may not be bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed in any reformed Church, though ſome of the Religion doe preſent them to Baptiſme, and publiquely vndertake the good education of them.

His wordes are theſe: Where there is no true Chriſt whereunto men can be ingraffed by Baptiſme, there true Baptiſme as touching the ſubſtance cannot be gotten, &amp;c. But in Popery there is no true Chriſt whereinto men may be ingraffed, &amp;c. Chap. 23. pag. 173.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Firſt, we are already receyued into the boſome of the Church, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged to haue the ſeale of the couenant, in as much as we were once offered and receyued into the number of the godly by the outwarde ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, though corruptly. To what end then ſhould baptiſme ſerue vs againe? In his exhort. to the gouernonrs, &amp;c. of Wales. pag. 31.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this be true which <hi>M. Penry</hi> ſaith, the outwarde and bare element deliuered by him, which in <hi>M. Penryes</hi> iudgement, is no minister, is the ſeale of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant: Which is a most abſurd hereſie.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly, the abſolute neceſſitie of baptiſme to ſaluation, by this meanes might ſeeme to be mainteined.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Falſe: They which require men vnbaptized, to offer themſelues to Baptiſme, are perſwaded that the contempt of the Sacrament is damnable: they doe not thinke that all which die without Baptiſme, (if contempt bee abſent) are dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Beſides, Baptiſme is neceſsarie in reſpect of our obedience: but, what obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is performed, when Baptiſme is refuſed?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly, leaſt wee ſhould ſeeme to agree with the heretical Catabaptiſts.</hi> If no Baptiſme was deliuered by vnpreaching ministers, <hi>M. Penry</hi> is an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Catabaptist, if hee dehort any ſuch from holy Baptiſme, as were baptized by vnpreaching ministers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly, other Churches haue not publikely decided the cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They needed not. They made no queſtion of it: for, with one voyce they condemne your Anabaptisticall fancies.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fiftly, that the practiſe ſhould not enforce them to bee rebaptized, which haue bene alreadie baptized, by ſuch as had commiſſion from the Lord to deale in thoſe myſteries.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they be already baptized, no reaſon they ſhould deſire a ſecond Baptiſme: for Baptiſme may not be iterated. I haue prooued this point in my Treatiſe of the Sacraments, and in this booke. Chap. <hi>19.</hi> pag. <hi>156.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Laſtly, they, who (being nowe in the age of diſcretion) haue beene bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed by Idoll miniſters, are either called or not called to ſaluation. If called, why ſhould they be rebaptized, ſeeing alreadie they haue bene made par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers of the outward element, and accompted in the number of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans? If not called, neither ſhould they be baptized, vntill they declared by their workes that they were Gods children.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If they receiued the Sacrament before, they neede not. If they receiued no Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament,
<pb facs="tcp:18219:27"/>they cannot abſteine from Baptiſme, without intollerable, both ſinne, and vengeance. None that are effectually called, either haue or will refuſe to offer themſelues to Baptiſme: which Baptiſme, before, they had not. <hi>Cornelius</hi> exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, doeth teach vs that, <hi>Acts. 10.</hi> Yea, I dare be bold to ſay, that her Maiesties ſubiects which are vnbaptized, and do not offer themſelues to Baptiſme, are not as yet effectually called, whatſoeuer either they or you pretende. The reaſon is, None are effectually called, which are not within the compaſſe of Gods coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. The words of Gods couenant are theſe: <hi>I will be thy God and the God of thy ſeede. Gen. 17.</hi> Are they within the compaſse of this couenant, which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wittingly omit, or wilfully refuſe Baptiſme, which is the ſeale of Gods co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant?</p>

                     <hi>M. Penry ſayth, that the preaching of the worde is neceſſarily required in the adminiſtration of Baptiſme. chap. 7 pag. 82.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this were true, al ſuch as were Baptized without a Sermon, receiued no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I referre you to my anſwere, Chap. <hi>7.</hi> pag. <hi>84.</hi>

                     <hi>M. Penry ſayeth that Baptiſme is not out of the Church. Chap. 23. pag. 176.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is a groſse errour. Reade that which I haue written. Chap. <hi>21.</hi> pag. <hi>158.</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penryes iudgement is, that Queene Elizabeth and many thouſandes in England are vnbaptized.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That his iudgement is ſuch, I proue it by his owne wordes. He writeth thus, &amp;c. In Popery there is no true Christ whereunto men may be ingraffed, &amp;c. And a litle before: What Baptiſme is that which is not an ingraffing into the true Chriſt? Chap. <hi>23.</hi> pag. <hi>173.</hi> A litle after he hath theſe words: There is no Church at all in Popery. chap. <hi>23.</hi> pag. <hi>175. 176.</hi> And in an other place, &amp;c. that Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is not out of the Church. If <hi>M. Penry</hi> ſhall anſwere that it was Baptiſme in the Popiſh church yeſterday, but it is not ſo either to day or to morowe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Chriſt profeſſed now in Popery is not a true but a deuided Christ, I muſt needes tell him that Christ in the Popiſh profeſſion was diuided as well when her Maiestie, &amp;c. was Baptized, as he is deuided in the Popiſh profeſſion in this day. Beſides <hi>M. Penry</hi> writeth that the Popiſh church was neuer the Temple of God ſince Antichriſt planted his peſtilent chaire therein. Chap. <hi>22.</hi> pag. <hi>165.</hi> To conclude, ſeeing there is in <hi>M. Penryes</hi> iudgement no Church, no Baptiſme, no Miniſtery in the Popiſh church, &amp;c. I may be bold to affirme that in <hi>M. Penryes</hi> iudgement her Maiestie and many thouſandes more are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>M. Penry ſaith that the holy Supper is an extraordinary Sacrament which is deliuered priuately by a Miniſter. Chap. 14. pag. 139.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This error is condemned by <hi>M. Caluine,</hi> whoſe reſolution is, that it is lawfull to adminiſter the holy Supper priuately, if certaine cautions be obſerued. I reſt in his iudgement. I referre you to chap. <hi>15.</hi> page <hi>141. 142.</hi>

                     <hi>M. Penry is bolde to control Almightie God, for barring the vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Iſraelites from eating the Paſchall lambe: His words are theſe, why ſhould the godly of the family be excluded from the action, the cauſe why they were vncircumciſed not being in them?

                  </p>
                  <p>This is intollerable ſaucineſse: It becommeth not duſt and aſhes to diſpute with, and to cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>termand the Maieſtie of God. Reade my anſwere, chap. <hi>8.</hi> pag. <hi>91. 92.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is an errour: for the Lords ordina<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce was, that only one ſhould be the high prieſt: and it is manifeſt in the text, that Annas &amp; Caiphas were high prieſts together, luke <hi>3.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If this were true, firſt, a great number are vnbaptized.

                     <hi>M. Penry affirmeth readers to be no miniſters, and for any thing that is reuealed in the worde, that they can deliuer no Sacrament, and yet that which hath bene done by them, may be a Sacrament: and what contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietie (ſaith hee) is there in theſe aſſertions?

                     <hi>M. Penry ſayth, that he hath no miniſterie, which ſinneth in executing the workes of the miniſterie, as adminiſtring Sacraments &amp;c. His wordes are theſe: the calling of an vnpreaching miniſter, is not the calling of the miniſterie, becauſe he ſinneth in intermedling with the workes thereof. Chap. 25.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this were true, the contentious miniſters of Philippi, were no ministers: for, they ſinned in executing the workes of the miniſterie. That appeareth in theſe wordes of the Apostle: Some preach Chriſt through enuie and ſtrife, Phi. <hi>1.15.</hi> Beſides, M.

                  <p>If he meane, that it doth not furniſh a miniſter with knowledge, I graunt it. If he meane that it doth not make him a miniſter to vs, then were the ignorant Leuiticall prieſts no prieſts in the Iewiſh Church. Which ignorant Leuiticall prieſts, in M.

                  <p>M. Penry ſayth in an other place, that no ministerie is ſeperated from a gift. Againe, whoſoeuer preſerueth not knowledge in his lippes, is no miniſter: in his addition page <hi>57. 58.</hi> Againe, to make a miniſter, there be two things required: First, a being or life, which the Lord onely can giue: Secondly, a birth, which the Church, as an inſtrument of the ordinance of God, is to beſtowe vpon him by his outward calling. Theſe two things are ſo eſſentially to be required in a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that whoſoeuer wanteth either of them, he cannot poſſibly be a miniſter. Againe, be it, that a man haue the outward calling of the Church: yet in deede, he is no miniſter, vnleſse the Lorde hath giuen him the life of a minister, by committing the word of reconciliation vnto his hands: in his addi. page <hi>45. 46.</hi> M. Penry erreth greatly eyther in his firſt, or laſt propoſitions. If he can recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile them, hee can worke miracles.

                     <p>I doe ſee as yet no difference betwene vs. If <hi>M. Penry</hi> denieth them not to be Sacraments which are adminiſtred by Popiſh prieſts &amp; vnpreaching Miniſters, hee can not deny Popiſh prieſts and vnpreaching Miniſters to haue a calling, &amp;c. For it is a rule in Diuinitie: <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentum

                     <p>Paul communicated ſince his conuerſion with thoſe Prieſts that were as vnlearned as euer any. Which he would not haue done if inabilitie to teach had made them no Prieſtes.</p>

                     <p>Then in <hi>M. Penryes</hi> iudgement, the holy Apoſtle was not polluted by communicating with vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Miniſters. Can any man (if he haue but halfe an eye) ſuſpect that <hi>M. Penry</hi> diſſenteth from me in iudgement? What then may I thinke, againſt whom he hath written? Well, I muſt be content with the meaſure he offereth me. My comfort is, that he ſhall gaine, and I loſe nothing by it. Yea, I aſſure my ſelfe by Gods grace that Gods Church ſhal gaine by this difference. Hee pretendeth great deſire of a learned Miniſterie: but his eagre defence of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call prieſts, bewrayeth him. If I had written ſo much for ignorant Miniſters, the great bell had bene rung out before this. I ſhould haue had it on both ſides of mine eares. I haue dealt very earneſtly and humbly by writings and ſpeache for a learned Miniſterie. I haue receiued very comfortable anſwere of very great and honourable perſonages: who haue alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>die (thankes be to God) employed ſome, and will, I doubt not, employ more in the Churches ſeruice. The Lord increaſe that bleſſing for his Chriſts ſake.
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:18219:29"/>The marke, I feare, which <hi>M. Penry</hi> leauels at, is, ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to condemne the outwarde calling of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in our Church: and ſo to ſhake hands with the Anabaptiſticall Recuſants. Though he hit not that white, hee will hardly miſſe that Butte. If hee bee throughly ſearched, it is not vnlike to fall out ſo. Some part of his writings looke ſhrewdly that way.</p>

Gather the people together: men and women, and children, and thy ſtranger that is within thy gates, that they may heare, and that they may learne, and feare the Lord your God, and keepe, and obſerue all the wordes of this law. And that their children which haue not knowen it, may heare it, and learne to feare the Lord your God, &amp;c. Deut. 31.</hi> I gather my argument out of this place thus. By reading of the lawe of God, the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites did learne and feare God: therefore they were edified. If you reply that all the Iſraelites did not profite by this reading, I anſwere, no more did all profit by the preaching of the Prophets, of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the Apoſtles. The fault was not in the ſeed, but in the ground.

<pb n="63" facs="tcp:18219:33"/>reade therein all dayes of his life, that hee may learne to feare the Lorde his God, and to keepe all the woordes of this lawe, and theſe ordinances, for to doe them: That his heart be not lifted vp aboue his brethren, and that hee turne not from the commandement, to the right hand or to the left, but that he may prolong his dayes in his kingdome, hee, and his ſonnes in the middes of Iſrael. Deut. 17.</hi> I frame my argument thus. The king is commaunded to reade the lawe of God, that hee may learne to feare God, and decline pride: therefore the reading of the law of God doth edifie.</p>
                  <p>In king <hi>Ioſias</hi> time, the booke of the lawe was found by <hi>Hilkiah</hi> the Prieſt. This booke was read in the Lordes houſe.

                  <p>

                  <p>The Apoſtle writeth thus to the paſtours and people of <hi>Coloſſe: Let the worde of Chriſt dwell in you plenteouſly, &amp;c.

                     <hi>Victorinus</hi> was an Oratour in <hi>Rome.</hi> By reading the Scriptures he became a Chriſtian: <hi>Mirante Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, gaudente eccleſia:</hi> that is, <hi>Rome</hi> marueyled at <hi>Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torinus</hi> conuerſion: Gods Church was glad of it. <hi>Aug.

                  </p>
                  <p>Gods ſpeach vnto vs, I am ſure, doth edifie: when the Scriptures are read, God ſpeaketh vnto vs. The holy Scriptures are <hi>Dei Epiſtola. &amp;c.</hi> that is, Gods E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>By reading the Scriptures, Gods people do more eaſily receiue Gods holy truth, and eſpie Popiſh ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities and Anabaptiſticall fancies.</p>
                  <p>They which miſlike the reading of the ſcriptures, are <hi>Zwingfildians,</hi> that is, abſurde heretikes. What then is maſter <hi>Penry,</hi> which writeth that the worde barely read, and to no other purpoſe then to edifie by reading, is not wholeſome doctrine?</p>
                  <p>If any ſhall gather of this I haue ſet downe, that I am an enemie to the preaching of the word, hee de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerueth no anſwere. My iudgement is: If the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the holy ſcriptures doeth edifie, that ſounde preaching doeth edifie much more. By ſound prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, I vnderſtand the giuing of the true ſenſe of the ſcripture, and applying it to the profite of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:18219:34"/>auditours. Thus did <hi>Ezra, Chriſt,</hi> the Apoſtles, preach. This courſe, I am ſure, doeth highly pleaſe God, and bringeth many ſheepe into the Lordes folde. The Lorde increaſe the number of ſuch tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, that Gods religion may flouriſh as <hi>Aarons</hi> rod did, and that Popiſh and Anabaptiſticall errours may be deuoured as the roddes of the Egyptian ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerers were.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>Here be two things (M. D. SOME) wherein you by oppugning that trueth, which out of the worde of God I had ſet downe, concerning the two former queſtions, haue bene wanting both vnto your ſelfe and to the cauſe: the defence whereof you vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke. The former want of the two, appeareth by your ſpare dealing in a matter of ſuch great weight: wherin you haue dealt with ſo illiberal a hand, that what hath bene writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by you, might ſeeme to proceede rather from any then from a man whoſe gifts and learning ſeemed to promiſe the affording of greater and more weightie matters, then any ſet downe in that treatiſe.</p>

                     <p>Your beginning is full of courage. I do not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at it. He that runneth alone, is alwayes formoſt. You accuſe me to withſtande Gods trueth. A ſore charge. If true, I muſt reuerſe my iudgement: if vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>true,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:18219:35"/>true, you haue dealt iniuriouſly with me. When <hi>Ioas</hi> was aduanced to the Imperiall Crowne of <hi>Iuda, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalia</hi> cried, <hi>Treaſon, Treaſon. 2. Chron. 23.</hi> A hard ſpeach againſt king <hi>Ioas, Iehoiada, &amp;c.</hi> But <hi>Athalia</hi> her ſelfe was the Traitour. You ſhall apply this. I haue dealt, you ſay, verie ſparingly in a matter of great importance. If I haue ſo, your aduantage is greater. If the ſeede ſowen in my booke, were like yours, I might be iuſtly thought to bee verie prodigall. My treatiſe, I perceiue, is not for your tooth: it is ſimple in your eye. <hi>Aquila non capit muſcas.</hi> It hath pleaſed many, I thanke God, of excellent learning and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome to like of it: That is my comfort. <hi>Inſtar mille, Platonis calculus.</hi> I make very meane account, as yet, of your iudgement. You are not read, you are to ſeeke in the principles of diuinitie, you haue bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched groſſe errours, you know not your ignorance. For that knowledge which Almightie God hath gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen me, I thanke his Maieſtie verie humbly. It is more, I confeſſe, then I am worthie of. God giue me grace to vſe it to his glorie.</p>

                     <p>The number of my reaſons were many: you onely haue touched two of them, the reſt are not dealt with. And therefore the cauſe as yet remai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth whole. For, be it you had anſwered theſe two as you haue not, yet had you not ſatisfied the doubtfull conſcience of thoſe, that know not in theſe points which way to turne them, as long as any one of my reaſons remayned vnanſwered.</p>

                     <p>Your reaſons, I confeſſe, haue number: but they want weight. I haue confuted three of them. The firſt of the three, is accompted by you a pillar of marble. But I haue not, you ſay, dealt with the reſt. Content yourſelfe: I haue made no fault. I anſwered
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:18219:35"/>ſuch and ſo many, as were deliuered to me by ſome of your faction. When I had finiſhed my treatiſe, your booke was brought me: before, I knew not that you were the father of them. You denie that I haue anſwered any of your reaſons. It is eaſie to ſay ſo, and you might worſt haue ſayde it. A partie is vnfit to be a Iudge. Your reaſons are all of one ſtampe: therefore the ouerthrow of the principall, is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerthrow of all. Your followers vvhich knowe not which way to turne them, may thanke both you and themſelues: you, for ſowing: themſelues, for reaping ſuch giddie fancies. It is an eaſie thing to leade and fall into an Anabaptiſticall maze. They will not bee ſatisfied, you ſay, before euery one of your reaſons bee anſwered. A peremptorie reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They are pinned be like on your ſleeue. I hope wee ſhall not haue a <hi>Pythagoras</hi> of you. Woulde you haue your boiſterous ſpeech go for an Oracle, and cary all as a violent ſtreame before it? God forbid. It were a hard caſe. I truſt you deſire it not.

                     <p>In this point there is alſo another want, which I would had beene re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed. And that is of two ſortes. Firſt, a manifeſt going from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouerſie: for the queſtion being, whether ignorant men, not ordeyned of God for the gathering together of the Saintes, bee miniſters or no: you leaue that, and proue the Sacraments adminiſtred by them, viz. by popiſh prieſts, &amp; our dumbe miniſters, in the dayes of blindnes and ignorance, to be ſacraments, which is no part of the matter in controuerſie, but an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther point to be diſcuſſed (if men will be gotten at all to enter thereunto) when the former is determined and decided.</p>

                     <p>Your ſpeeches are very idle. I ſwarue not one iot from the cauſe I dealt in. For proofe of this, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der what I write. Certaine in <hi>London</hi> gaue out in my
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:18219:36"/>hearing: firſt, that ſuch as were baptized by Popiſh Prieſts in the Popiſh Church, and by vnpreaching miniſters in our Church, receiued no baptiſme: Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the Godly were polluted, which recey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued any Sacrament at the hands of vnpreaching mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. To heale theſe ſores, I was deſired to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uide a plaiſter. I did ſo, and God hath giuen a good bleſſing vnto it. All this time your booke was as great a ſtranger to me, as it is nowe to the Duke of <hi>Medina.</hi> What ſay you M. <hi>Penry?</hi> Haue I faulted as you imagine? Had you any the leaſt cauſe ſo rough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſeaze vpon me, and to charge me with going from the point? Bee iudge your ſelfe: yea, I refuſe not the iudgement of your diſciples, if they haue a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dramme of equitie in them.</p>

                     <p>Secondly, your reaſons are ſo fewe, and ſo commonly knowen vnto al, that for their number a ſmall deale of paper might conteyne an anſwere vnto them: for their noueltie, they could not put a man that had accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vnto knowledge, but once allowed of the cauſe, to any great labour in anſwering them. As being things ſo commonly obiected by al, learned or vnlearned, that hold our readers to be miniſters, and thinke it lawfull to communicate with them, as by courſe of ſpeech they fall vnto that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, where all men may eaſily ſee, that there was a great ouerſight committed by M <hi>Some,</hi> in deeming that the oppugning of a cauſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenanced by moſt of the Godly learned, would bee taken in hand by any, who could not anſwere the reaſons which he might be ſure would be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iected by all. And who could bee ignorant, that the odious controuerſie, concerning the profanation of baptiſme, both by Popiſh Prieſtes, and our dumbe Miniſters, would offer it ſelfe in the forefront to withſtande the trueth? that the ciuill Magiſtracie, the miniſterie of the dumbe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, the corrupt outwarde calling of our readers woulde require an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere, which are the reaſons, and the onely reaſons vſed by you.</p>

<pb n="69" facs="tcp:18219:36"/>as I deſired. If they bee not for your diet, I doe not paſſe: my thought is taken. If nothing were good or bad, but that which you like or miſlike, precious pearles ſhould go for tile ſherdes, and pebble ſtones for Diamonds. <hi>Tichonius</hi> a Donatiſt ſaid of himſelfe and his fellowes: <hi>Quod volumus, ſanctum eſt.</hi> Your muſicke, I hope, is not like his. If it bee, you are too imperiall: You will not be abidden. What, and how weake my reaſons are, muſt bee decided hereafter: for, your wordes are no arguments. If my reaſons were ſutable to your anſweres, they were very wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. Your odious ſpeech that I withſtand the trueth, is vſed often: it is a ſpeciall flowre in your booke. This courſe hurts you and not me. It hurts you: for it bewrayes your humour. It hurts not me: for your tongue cannot diſgrace me.</p>

                     <p>The laſt want I finde in you, is conteyned in the inſufficiencie of your reaſons, which euidently ſhewe the inſufficiencie of the concluſion, that would be inferred by them. Your reaſons are all of them faultie, either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they deſire that for graunted which is the queſtion, or make thoſe things of like nature, wherein there is a great diſſimilitude. From the firſt of the two faults it commeth to paſſe, that you take for graunted, that the writings of reuerend and godly men, as of <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> M. <hi>Beza, &amp;c.</hi> will proue that which the worde of the eternall God doth not warrant. Hence you take it granted, that Popiſh Prieſts were miniſters: that the outward approbation of the Church, maketh a Miniſter: that, whenſoeuer the word of inſtitution is pronounced with the outwarde element, there muſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be a Sacrament: that, I take an euill Miniſter for no Miniſter: that, there was a nullitie both of <hi>Caiphas</hi> miniſterie, becauſe he came in by bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berie, and of the litigious Miniſters in the Church of <hi>Philippi, &amp;c.</hi> Howſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>euer you take thoſe things as graunted principles, yet they are the poynts in controuerſie, and ſo farre from being yeelded vnto by me, that I haue ſhewed euery one of them to be manifeſtly falſe.</p>

                     <speaker>R. Some.</speaker>
                     <p>You finde many faults. You are a hard man: you couer none. Moates with you are beames, and mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hils
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:18219:37"/>mountaines: yea, no moates and no molhils are beames and mountaines, if they appeare at your barre. It pleaſeth you to giue out that all my reaſons are faultie. If you meane in your eye, I doe eaſily grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t it: If you meane in the eye of the learned, you miſtake the matter. But what are the faultes which you purſue ſo hotly? Forſooth, I take that, you ſay, for graunted, which is the queſtion: viz. that Popiſh prieſts were miniſters: that whenſoeuer the word of inſtitution is added to the element, there is a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and that ſuch a thing is thus and ſo, becauſe <hi>Auguſtine</hi> and <hi>Beza</hi> write ſo. Your tongue is no ſlan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Did I euer ſay or write that Popiſh prieſtes had a lawfull calling? I haue written (I confeſſe) that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prieſts haue a calling, though a faultie one. Of this iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t are <hi>Beza, Caluin,</hi> the reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: But all theſe are wide of the Butte: onely you do hit the white: you wil teach them. <hi>Sus Mineruam.</hi> It beco<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>meth not the houſe. Did I euer ſay or write, that whenſoeuer the worde of Inſtitution is added to the eleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, there muſt preſently be a Sacrament? There is no ſillable in my treatiſe, that lookes that way. You imagine I ſay ſo: and of this abſurd con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceite, you conclude that priuate men, children, wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, idiots (in my iudgeme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t) may adminiſter a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. You pretend great ſinceritie: but your dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling with me in this and ſome other points, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt nor ſcholerlike. It ſhall appeare ſo by Gods grace in this booke. Theſe particulars, &amp; that of <hi>Caiphas</hi> prieſthood, and of the contentious mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of <hi>Philippi,</hi> ſhall be handled in their ſeuerall places.</p>

                     <p>The diſſimilitude is in the reaſons drawen from the Leuiticall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, and the ciuill magiſtracie: with whom if you compare the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie of the new couenant, you ſhall finde, firſt, that you bring in a ſimilitude to ſhewe that which is not proued: and ſecondly, that you make thoſe to be twinnes, which all men muſt needes graunt to be as vnlike, as crooked and ſtraight lines are vnmatchable.</p>

                     <speaker>R. Some.</speaker>
                     <p>My ſecond fault is, as you ſay, in drawing an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument from the Leuiticall prieſthood to the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie of the newe Teſtament. Is this a fault? no, no: the fault is in your eye, not in my pen: but, why may I not drawe an argument, as I did from the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical prieſthood, to the miniſterie of the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Your reaſon is: the Leuiticall prieſthood and the miniſterie of the new Teſtament are not twins, are vnmatchable, they ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand together: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a reaſon cannot be drawen from the one to the other. You take this, I am ſure, to be an inuincible argument: but it is as ſtrong as a rope of ſand. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie your argument. My reaſons are: firſt, <hi>Aaron</hi> did not take the prieſthood vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> him before he was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led: therefore none in our time, may enter into the miniſterie, vnleſſe he be called. This argument is grounded vpon theſe words of the Apoſtle: <hi>No man taketh this honour vnto himſelfe, but hee that is called of God as Aaron. Heb. 5.</hi> Secondly, the Leuiticall prieſts ought to be furniſhed with knowledge, therefore the miniſters of the new Teſtament &amp;c. The ground of this reaſon is ſet downe by the Prophet <hi>Malachi</hi> in this ſort: <hi>The prieſts lippes ſhal preſerue knowledge, and they ſhall ſeeke the Lawe at his mouth: for he is the meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the Lord of Hoſtes. Mal. 2.</hi> You ſee nowe, I hope, that an argument may be framed from the Leuiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:18219:38"/>prieſthood to the miniſterie of the newe Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: if you doe not, you are ſtarke blind: if you do, confeſſe your ignorance. Thirdly, the miniſterie of death and condemnation, and the miniſterie of the ſpirite and righteouſneſſe: that which ſhould be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed, and that which remaineth, are things ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry farre and greatly different: yet an argument may be drawe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> from the one to the other in this ſort. The lawe which was the miniſterie of death, of condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and which ſhould be aboliſhed, was glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: therefore the Goſpel which is the miniſterie of the ſpirite and righteouſnes, and which remaineth, is more glorious. This argument is, as the Logici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans call it, <hi>à comparatis:</hi> and is ſoundly gathered out of theſe wordes of the holy Apoſtle: <hi>If the ministra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of death was glorious, how ſhall not the miniſtration of the ſpirit be more glorious? If the ministerie of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was glorious, much more doth the miniſtration of righteouſnes exceede in glory: if that which ſhould be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed was glorious, much more ſhall that which remaineth be glorious. 2. Cor. 3.</hi> What ſay you nowe maſter <hi>Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry?</hi> doe you not perceiue by this I haue ſet downe, that an argument may be drawen very aptly from one thing to another, wherein there is great diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litude: which are not twinnes, which are vnmatche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able? if you doe, be wiſer hereafter in the name of God. Whether an argument may be drawen from the ciuill magiſtracie, ſhall appeare in an other place.</p>

I ſee litle hope of agreement betweene you and me in theſe particulars. I am reſolute in my iudgement: if you be ſo in yours, I am ſory for you. God giue you an other minde.</p>

                        <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Owe I am to come to your booke: from the 20. page whereof vnto the 28. laying the foundation of the reaſons you vſe againſt me, to proue the lawfulneſſe of communicating with dumbe miniſters, you han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle two needeleſſe points. Firſt, that they which were baptized by popiſh prieſts, haue receiued true baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me as touching the ſubſtance. Secondly, that they are the Sacraments of baptiſme, and the holy Supper of the Lord, which are deliuered in the Church of England by vnpreaching miniſters. In theſe two points, M. <hi>Some,</hi> you haue proued nothing that my writings haue denied: but you haue quickened a dead controuerſie, not vnlikely to giue the wrangling ſpirits of this age, cauſe to breede greater ſturres in the Church. I ſee no other effect, which the handling of theſe queſtions can bring foorth but this. And it is to be feared that the ſlendernes of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons vſed in your booke, to proue that which you haue vndertaken to ſhew, will giue occaſion vnto many, who of themſelues are too too ready to iangle, to doubt of that whereof before they made no queſtion. So that by ſeeking to ſtay the courſe of a needeful controuerſie, you haue both giuen it a larger paſſage, and opened the doore vnto a queſtion very fruitleſſe in our time. You knowe I deale in neither of theſe pointes. If you cannot be ſtayed from entring into controuerſies that are very odious, and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinent vnto the matter in hande: it were good that the Church were further and more ſoundly ſatisfied by you in theſe two points, which you alone in our Church haue publiquely called in queſtion. And for mine owne part, when you haue done, I knowe not who will be your aduerſarie. I ſee no reaſon why I ſhoulde deale in controuerſies of ſo ſmall gaine. Of this I am aſſured, that neither Popiſh prieſtes, nor any other ignorant guides are Miniſters. Whether the Element adminiſtred by them, be a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t or no, looke you to that, which haue in your Treatiſe debated that, which my writings neuer called into queſtion. If you will needes proue readers to be Miniſters, becauſe you cannot get mee to denie that which hath bene adminiſtred to be a Sacrament, you ſhall but preſſe that which will proue nothing. Your reaſon is, as if you ſhould ſay, that either all they which ſupplie the places of miniſters are miniſters, or els an inconueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is likely to followe. A ſtrange maner of demonſtration: Gods ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance muſt needes be thruſt out of the doores, becauſe an inconuenience would be likely to enſue the admitting of it. The cauſe will not be thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered at your hands, and I am ſory that a man ſo reuerend in mine eyes, hath dealt ſo vnſubſtantially, in a matter belonging to the ſeruice of the euerliuing God: the ſlenderneſſe of the reaſon is apparant. In the latter end of the booke I haue further ſhewed the ſame: thither I am to referre you and the reader.</p>

                     <p>You are come at the laſt to my treatiſe. In Gods name. You giue out that I dealt in two needeleſſe points. Not ſo, by your leaue: for ſome in London and other places, being ſeduced by vnſkilfull tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers, denied them both. You do not ſo, your words are as cleare as the day, and are theſe: <hi>In theſe two poyntes M. Some &amp;c. you haue proued nothing that my writings haue denied.</hi> I thanke you for this. You are nowe in a very good moode: but you will not be ſo long. <hi>Virtutes latere no<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> poſſunt.</hi> Ful veſſels wil burſt, if they haue not a vent. If you deny not that true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme was deliuered by popiſh prieſtes and vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching miniſters, you cannot deny popiſh prieſtes and vnpreaching miniſters to haue a calling. My reaſon is: <hi>Nullum Sacramentum ſine miniſtro:</hi> that is, No Sacrament without a miniſter. The wrangling ſpirits you write of, are the more becauſe of your ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde writings: but they are not ſo many, thankes be to God, as you imagine. They which are ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde in iangling of theſe points, are either of your humour, which is very bad, or Anabaptiſticall recu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſants, which is ſomewhat worſe. You adde theſe words, <hi>A ſtrange manner of demonſtration</hi> &amp;c. They do proclaime your ignorance: they doe not anſwere my reaſon. I perceiue an argument <hi>ab abſurdo,</hi> is a pille that will not downe with you. The ſlendernes of my reaſons is repeated by you euery handwhile. It is like the Cuckoes ſong.

My grounds, you ſay, ſhalbe examined. Spare them not. Arraigne them if you will. But what ſhall I reaſon of, or looke for at your hands? To be acquited? no hope of that. To be condemned?

                     <p>The queſtion therefore is not whether the one or the other of them haue deliuered a Sacrament in reſpect of the action done, but whether a Chriſtian going vnto them for thoſe holy ſeales, may be aſſured, that hee can receiue the ſame at their hands. I affirme that wee cannot: <hi>M. Some</hi> taketh it graunted that we may. My warrant is out of the worde, becauſe there is no promiſe made to vs therein, that the action celebrated by ſuch men, is a Sacramentall action: and where there is no promiſe, there can be no aſſurance, becauſe our aſſurance ariſeth onely of faith, which muſt be grounded vpon the promiſes ſette downe in the worde. We haue no promiſe that they can deliuer vs a Sacrament, becauſe they are no miniſters. For they onely are enioyned by our Sauiour Chriſt to deliuer a Sacrament, neither doe we knowe what he can deliuer which is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter.</p>

Your wordes agree like harpe and harrowe. One while, you denie not that popiſh prieſtes and vnpreaching miniſters haue deliuered a ſacrament: An other while you knowe not what they can deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer: for, they are, as you ſay, no miniſters. To that ende you depraue Chriſts ſpeech in S. Matthew &amp;c. What dealing is this? Sacrament, and no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and all with one breath? What? can ſuch as are no miniſters, deliuer a Sacrament? If you ſay, No: then popiſh Prieſtes &amp; vnpreaching miniſters, neither haue nor can deliuer a Sacrament: for they are, as you ſay, no miniſters, that is, they haue no calling at all. Your diſciples are fit veſſels to receiue any liquor of yours: but men of learning and wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, are otherwiſe affected. They ſee clearely, that your dealing is abſurde and dangerous. Abſurde: for it is voyde of trueth. Dangerous: for it woulde breede confuſion. The magiſtrates, thankes bee to God, neither doe nor will ſuffer this bad courſe of yours. If they ſhould, fancies woulde (as weedes) growe too too faſt, and this noble land ſhoulde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue more hurt then your head is worth. I doubt not of their godly wiſdome. The miſerable eſtate of <hi>Germanie</hi> heretofore, by reaſon of Sectaries, may and will awake them.

You may leuell and le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uell againe at this marke: but you ſhall neuer hit it. The Bowe you ſhoote in, is too ſtrong: and your armes are very weake.

Your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, you muſt remember, I doe not denie, though your reaſon proueth not the ſame, which is thus framed. Whoſoeuer deliuer Gods baptiſme, they deliuer true baptiſme: But Popiſh prieſtes deliuer Gods baptiſme, therefore true baptiſme. You haue changed the concluſion from that which was done, vnto that which is done: But this ouerſight I omit. The aſſumption you proue thus: Whoſoeuer baptize in the name not of Pope or Idols, but of the holy Trinitie, they deliuer Gods baptiſme: but Popiſh prieſtes doe baptize in the name of the holy Trinitie, therefore they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuer Gods baptiſme. Your propoſition in this laſt Sillogiſme is moſt falſe, and ſuch as vpon the grant whereof, not onely the communicating with vnpreaching miniſters might be aduouched, but alſo Gods whole ordinance in the inſtitution of his holy Sacraments quite ouerthrowen. For if it were true, that there were no more required to make ſubſtantiall baptiſme (as you here require no more) but to baptize in the name of the Trinitie: then theſe impious abſurdities would followe thereof. 1 That an Amalekite might deliuer true circumciſion, as touching the ſubſtance. 2 That true baptiſme might be adminiſtred vnto a ſubſtance not capable of baptiſme: But this odious inſtance I will not vrge. 3. That a woman, 4. That any man not being a Miniſter, as a childe of fiue yeeres olde, a Turke, or Iewe, might deliuer true baptiſme as touching the ſubſtance. For
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:18219:42"/>theſe pronouncing the words of Inſtitution, might retaine, by your reaſon the eſſentiall forme of Chriſts baptiſme, and ſo to vſe your owne wordes, they baptizing not in the name of Pope or of Idols, but of the holy Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, ſhould deliuer Gods baptiſme and not mans?

<pb n="83" facs="tcp:18219:43"/>Otherwiſe, I do and wil account verie baſely of you. Hath the cauſe you deale for, Maieſtie in it? You might haue ſpared the name of Maieſtie verie well. It is too coſtly a garment for ſuch a leprous body, as your Treatiſe is. But I muſt beare with you. It is the maner of Sectaries to vſe maieſticall &amp; loftie words, that their ignorant followers may commend them aboue the skies. The reuerend dealing you talke of, is idle ſpeech. I haue and doe refuſe it. The erroni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſſertion which you fight againſt, is not mine: I did neuer ſo much as once thinke of it. It is yours: vſe it as you liſt. You may be bolde with it. You giue out, that I make the Sacrament to depend vpon the pronouncing of a fewe ſillables, without conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the perſon who is to adminiſter it. My anſwere is, that you are a wicked ſlaunderer. You re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire three things neceſſarily in the adminiſtration of baptiſme. Firſt, one which hath calling to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it. I agree with you in this. Secondly, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiall forme of conſecration conteined in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the holy inſtitution of Baptiſme. I diſſent from you in this, and yet doe like ſound preaching as well as you. Laſtly, the inuocation of the name of God. I ſay Amen to this. Then you adde this Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: but theſe could not poſſibly be in <hi>Egypt,</hi> that is, in the Popiſh Church, &amp;c. Will you ſtand to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond branch of the three? If you doe, I may iuſtly conclude, firſt that you account <hi>Conſecration,</hi> not Chriſts words in baptiſme, as you ought, but ſome gloſſe vpon Chriſtes wordes, which you ought not: Secondly, that you denie any Sacrament to be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered by Popiſh Prieſts, &amp; vnpreaching Miniſters; &amp;c. And yet you haue ſaid often, and haue deſired
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:18219:44"/>mee to remember that you denie it not. I doe not wring your wordes, and pull them out of ioynt, as you doe mine. Such dealing is an argument of a vile nature and wrangling ſpirit. It is verie farre, I thanke God, from me: I doe deteſt it. If I were of your hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, I could chaſe and purſue you hotly, for your inconſtancie &amp; errour: Inconſtancie, for affirming and denying one and the ſelfe ſame particular: Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, for giuing out that the worde preached is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily required to the Eſſence of the Sacrament. If a ſermon were neceſſarily required to the Eſſence of a Sacrament, theſe abſurdities woulde followe: Firſt, the Sacraments are dead Sacraments, that is, ſeales without writing, and plaine blankes, if there vvant a ſermon: Secondly, if Baptiſme be no ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vvithout a ſermon, then can it not regenerate or bee effectuall to any vvhich either haue bene, or are baptized vvithout a ſermon.</p>

                     <p>The Argument followes not. I confeſſe that Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh prieſts haue no lawfull calling: yet they haue a calling, though a faultie one. They which are not lawfully called vnto the miniſtery, are to be accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in another place then they which haue no cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. <hi>Caiphas</hi> was not in deed the lawfull high Prieſt: for he entred by money, and the Prieſthood in his time was rent in pieces: yet becauſe hee ſate in the high Prieſtes chaire, hee was accounted the high Prieſt. A faultie vocation may hurt him that v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurpes an office, but it doeth not defile thoſe thinges which are done by that partie. This is M. <hi>Bezaes</hi>

                     <p>Your diſtinction that Popiſh Prieſtes haue a calling, though a faultie, is a begging of the queſtion. For as I haue ſhewed, Popiſh Prieſts haue no calling at all in the Church, and therefore howe can they ſit in the chaire of the miniſterie? Is there a miniſterie out of the Church?

                     <p>The diſtinction vvhich you ſay is mine, is in deed M. <hi>Bezaes.</hi> It is tearmed by you a begging of the queſtion. Nay rather, your anſwere to M. <hi>Beza</hi> is beggerly, and none at all. If Popiſh prieſts (as you write) haue no calling at all: firſt, <hi>Luther,</hi> which had impoſition of handes in the Popiſh Church, had no externall calling at all: Secondly, in your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either no Baptiſme was deliuered by Popiſh Prieſts in the Popiſh Church: or, Baptiſme, if any were in the Popiſh Church, was adminiſtred by pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate men: for they which haue no calling at all, are priuate men. I neede not driue you to abſurde con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequents: you caſt your ſelfe headlong into them, as into a dangerous quauemire. Your Treatiſes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in you haue ſowen groſſe errours thicke and three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folde, are witneſſes ynough of this. Are not your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples moſt vnhappie, which depende on you as on another Pope? You aske whether there is a miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry out of the Church.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:18219:45"/>in the Popiſh Church which (you ſay) is no Church. <hi>Caiphas</hi> Prieſthoode hath both ſearched and founde you out. It bewrayeth your groſſe ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance.</p>

In ſteade of anſwering my reaſons, you aske me two queſtions: I muſt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to anſwere, there is no remedie. Your firſt que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is: Shall we ſay that they ſinne in not preſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting themſelues to be baptized? My anſwere is: they doe ſinne: no learned and godly man doubtes of it: my reaſons are: Firſt, Baptiſme is <hi>externus character,</hi> that is, the outward marke and badge of a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. ſo writeth that famous man M. <hi>Foxe, Cap. 14.</hi> in <hi>Apocal.</hi> Secondly, the contempt of circumciſion was grieuouſly puniſhed, <hi>Gen. 17.</hi> Yea, the Angel would haue killed <hi>Moſes,</hi> becauſe his ſonne was not circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, <hi>Exod. 4.</hi> Thirdly, they in the primitiue Church which had excellent graces, preſented themſelues to baptiſme: which baptiſme before, they had not. So did many in <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> after <hi>Peters</hi> ſermon, <hi>Act. 2.</hi> many in <hi>Samaria</hi> after <hi>Philips</hi> ſermons, <hi>Act. 8.</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Corinth</hi> after <hi>Pauls</hi> ſermons, <hi>Act. 18.</hi> Your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond queſtion is: to whom ſhould they preſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t them ſelues: who would baptize them? my anſwere is: after a publique profeſſion of their faith in the chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:18219:46"/>aſſembly, they muſt preſent themſelues to be baptized of the miniſter. So did <hi>Cornelius</hi> in <hi>Caeſarea, Act. 10. Lidia</hi> in <hi>Philippi, Acts. 16.

I hope you wil not gather of this, that I ſhut our infants from the holy Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: if you ſhould, you deſerue rather to be cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured by the Magiſtrate, then to be confuted by ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>

                        </gap>e they denie the receiuing of the Lords Supper, to haue bene a ſinne any more, then it would be a ſinne in them nowe to receiue the Lords Supper, if they could not haue Baptiſme.

Becauſe men will be ſo iniurious vnto them, as to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny them the comfort of baptiſme, which they cannot haue, ſhoulde they denie to themſelues the comfort of the Lordes Supper which they may haue?

                     <p>You anſwere very ſtrangely. Your wittes, I thinke, were a wooll gathering. If they ſinned in partaking the Lordes ſupper before they were baptized, there is great reaſon they ſhoulde abſtaine from the holy table, vntill they bee baptized: which Baptiſme (if the caſe ſo required) might orderly and eaſily bee come by. But they omitted baptiſme, you ſay, of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noraunce, not of contempt: therefore they ſinned not, which being vnbaptized did partake the holy Supper. I denie your argument: My reaſon is: <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tia excuſat non à toto, ſed à tanto:</hi> that is, Ignorance maketh the fault leſſe, it doth not make it none. M. <hi>Penry</hi> at the length toucheth one part of my reaſon: but by his leaue I will firſt ſet downe my whole rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and then his anſwere. My reaſon is this: None vncircumciſed might eat the paſſeouer. <hi>Exod. 12.48.</hi> therefore, none vnbaptized may receiue the holy Supper. M. <hi>Penryes</hi> anſwere is conteined in theſe wordes: True, But what ſhall we ſay vnto thoſe that were vncircumciſed in the wilderneſſe fortie yeeres almoſt. <hi>Ioſua. 5.5.</hi> Did they neuer eate the Paſſeouer all that time? If they did, the place of <hi>Exodus</hi> will be quickely anſwered. It is plaine that the Paſſeouer was celebrated in the wilderneſſe once at the leaſt. <hi>Nombers 9.1.</hi> If euery yeere, why ſhoulde the godly of the familie bee excluded from the action, the cauſe why they were vncircumciſed not being in them? Call you this anſwering? There was neuer any ſuch I am ſure in <hi>Cambridge</hi> or <hi>Oxford.</hi> It came I thinke out of <hi>Barbarie.</hi> I hope you are aſhamed of it by this time. You aske mee whether they which were vncircumciſed in the wilderneſſe almoſt fortie
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:18219:47"/>yeeres, did all that time neuer eate the Paſſeouer? My anſwere is, that no ſuch thing appeareth in the text: and where the holy Ghoſt ſtayeth his penne, it becommeth vs to ſtay our tongues. Yea, it is cleare in <hi>Ioſue,</hi> that the Iſraelites, after they were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, did keepe the feaſt of the Paſſeouer. <hi>Ioſ. 5.8.10.</hi> You adde, If the Iſraelites being vncircumciſed, did partake the Paſſeouer, that the place in <hi>Exodus</hi> will be quickely anſwered. You ſay true. If the skie fall, you ſhall catch Larkes. When you proue this <hi>(if)</hi> of yours, I wil accept your anſwere. Till then, you ſhal pardon me. You proceed in this ſort, It is plaine you ſay that the Paſſeouer was celebrated in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, once at the leaſt, <hi>Numb. 9.</hi> Will you conclude of this: therefore they which were vncircumciſed did eate the Paſſeouer? If you doe, I denie your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument: My reaſon is: If they had admitted any vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>circumciſed to the Paſſeouer, they had prophaned the holy Sacrament. The wordes in the text are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt: <hi>If a ſtranger dwell with thee, and will obſerue the Paſſeouer of the Lord, let him circumciſe all the males, that belong vnto him, and then let him come and obſerue it, and he ſhall bee as one that is borne in the lande: for, no vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſed perſon ſhall eate thereof. One lawe ſhall bee to him that is borne in the land, and to the ſtranger that dwelleth among you. Exod. 12.</hi> An other reaſon of yours is: the cauſe why the Iſraelites were vncircumciſed, was not in them: therefore the godly vncircumciſed of the family might not be barred from the Paſſeouer. I anſwere: your argument is naught, and verie ſaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie: for, you comptroll Almightie God by whome they were barred. This is no pride, M. <hi>Penry.</hi> I might ſay to you as the Apoſtle in another caſe: <hi>O man, who
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:18219:48"/>art thou that pleadeſt againſt God? hath not the potter power of the Clay, &amp;c. Rom. 9.</hi> I confeſſe that the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites ceaſed from circumciſion in the wildernes: and yet were not faultie in omitting and deferring cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion: for, they had Gods ſpeciall diſpenſation to do ſo, becauſe they were in co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuall trauaile: and people being newly circumciſed, could abide no la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. For the ſurer proofe of this point: vidz. that none which are knowen to bee vnbaptized, may ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther preſent themſelues, or be admitted to the holy Supper, I offer theſe reaſons to the godly Reader. Firſt, Baptiſme is an entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce into the viſible church: the holy Supper is a confirmation of this entrance. Secondly, they which were of yeeres in the primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue Church were firſt baptized, and afterwarde re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued the holy Supper. This is manifeſt in theſe wordes of S. <hi>Luke: Then they that gladly receyued his worde, were baptized: and the ſame day, there were added to the Church about three thouſand ſoules. And they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in the Apoſtles doctrine and fellowſhip, and brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of bread and prayers, &amp;c.

                     <p>If ſuch as vvere baptized by popiſh Prieſts in the popiſh Church, and by vnpreaching miniſters in the Church of England, receiued no Sacrament, many excellent men haue vſurped the preachers office. My reaſon is: It is vnlawful for any man to be a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique teacher in the viſible Church, which is not by baptiſme graft into, and ſo become a member of the viſible Church. Our Sauiour Chriſt was baptized of <hi>Iohn</hi> in Iordane before he preached. <hi>Mat. 3.</hi> and <hi>4.

                     <p>The truth I perceiue, is mightie. It maketh the enemie many times to confeſſe it: ſo doth it you in this place. Your wordes are cleare for me, and flat againſt your ſelfe. You grant that none vncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed might miniſter before the altar. I thanke you for it. Of this I conclude: therefore none vnbapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed may be a publique teacher in the viſible church. Thus, you ſee by the way, which may not be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, that an argument may bee drawen from the Leuiticall prieſthood to the miniſterie of the newe teſtament: which prieſthood and miniſterie are not twinnes, are vnmatcheable and cannot ſtand toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. I confeſſe my ſelfe greatly bound vnto you: you deale very liberally with me: for you reach me arguments (as weapons) to ſmite your ſelfe withall. <hi>M.

                     <p>The vnpreaching miniſters doe adde the worde vnto the Element in the adminiſtration of Baptiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me: therefore it is the Sacrament of Baptiſme which is deliuered by them. <hi>Accedit verbum ad Elementum, &amp; fit Sacramentum.

By <hi>(worde)</hi> in Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is vnderſtanded the worde of Inſtitution, which is, to baptize in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghoſt, &amp;c.

                     <p>Your next reaſon, page 23. is ſlender. Readers pronounce the wordes of Inſtitution with the deliuerie of the Element, therefore (ſay you) they deliuer a Sacrament. You haue once already alledged this to prooue po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh baptiſme, page 20. I haue anſwered it page 29. 30. 31. And the place of <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.19. brought in by you page 23. prooueth your conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to bee falſe. For it ſheweth, that hee, who is to baptize, muſt bee alſo able to teache, which abilitie is wanting in our Readers. <hi>Goe,</hi> ſayth our Sauiour, <hi>and teache all nations, baptizing &amp;c.</hi> Therefore if hee, that deliuereth the Element, be not able to teache, we cannot be aſſured, that it is a Sacrament: Becauſe the commaundement is not generally to all that coulde pronounce the wordes of Inſtitution, being thereunto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted by the corruption of the time, but particularly limitted vnto them that can teache, vnleſſe you will ſay that the Lorde biddeth them goe teache, who cannot teache: which were not once to bee conceiued of his Maieſtie.</p>

You deny my conſequent, and doe adde for your reaſon an obiection ſet downe by me a litle after. My anſwere to that obiection is extant and very direct. I reſt in it: I did neuer ſay or thinke that Almightie God did either command or allow any to be a prieſt in the old, or a miniſter in the new Teſtament, which had not gifts in ſome meaſure. It pleaſeth you to write in your treatiſe, that vnfitnes to teach made not a nullitie of the Leuiticall prieſts office. If you meane, that it made not a nullitie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God, you conceiue very baſely of Almightie God: for, you make him to allowe ignorant men to be his prieſts in the olde Teſtament: which abſurde courſe would haue brought great diſhonour to his Maieſtie, and great hurt to the Church of the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites. I doe nowe but touch this groſſe and blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous paradoxe of yours: and (with the dog of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt) doe, as it were, ſippe and away: but I will exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it more ſurely hereafter, that the reader may ſee clearely, as in a Chriſtall glaſſe, what baſe ware you commend vnto vs for excellent diuinitie.</p>

                     <p>You meane, as I take it, by the worde added to the Element, the worde preached: but you doe not ſay
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:18219:50"/>flatly here (though you haue a little before) that the want of a Sermon maketh the action fruſtrate, that is, the ſacrament to be no ſacrament. I confeſſe that <hi>Paul</hi> preached at <hi>Troas</hi> in the adminiſtration of the holy Supper, <hi>Act. 20.7.</hi> and that the Apoſtles did teach the Gentiles before they baptized them, <hi>Mat. 28.19.</hi> But no learned man will conclude of this, that a Sermon is ſimplie neceſſarie to the Eſſence of a Sacrament. If you will know, what I thinke of ſound preaching before the adminiſtration of the holy ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, my anſwer is, that I do greatly both like and commend it. Yea, I doe wiſh with all my heart, that all the Churches in Englande had able teachers to performe that dutie. This minde was I euer of, ſince I knewe what Gods religion and good diuinitie meant.

                     <p>The Argument is verie weake. I confeſſe, that Chriſt co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>manded his Apoſtles, firſt to teach ſuch as were of yeres and alients from his religion, and then to baptize them. If the Gentiles had not bene firſt taught, they woulde not haue offered themſelues, nor the Apoſtles admitted them to the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme. If any will conclude of this place in ſaint <hi>Matthewe,</hi> that none whatſoeuer may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to baptiſme, before they be taught: they ſhut our infants from the holy ſacrament, and therefore are Catabaptiſts.</p>

For doe you thinke, that the worde of inſtitution, being, as you ſay, the ſumme of Chriſts Sermon, is then an edifying worde, whenſoeuer it is recited by a prophane perſon, euen in the prophanation of Gods ordinance? Looke 2. <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.3. and you ſhall finde that the worde barely read, and to no other purpoſe, then to edifie by reading, is not holſome doctrine.

That the reader may be aſſured, that the ſumme of Chriſts Sermon, is an edifying word, I will firſt ſet downe the word of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, which is the ſumme of Chriſts Sermon, and then proue the point. The word of inſtitution in the holy Supper, is: <hi>The Lord Ieſus the ſame night that he was betrayed, tooke bread: and when he had giuen thanks, he brake it, and ſaide, Take, eate: this is my body, which is broken for you: this doe ye in remembrance of me.

Cor. 11.</hi> That this word of Inſtitution doth edifie, it is mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt: for it teacheth vs, firſt, who did inſtitute the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:18219:52"/>Supper: <hi>The Lord Ieſus.</hi> Secondly, at vvhat time: <hi>The ſame night that he was betrayed.</hi> Thirdly, vvhat the Elements are in the holy Supper: <hi>Bread and wine.</hi> Fourthly, what our Sauiour Chriſt did: <hi>Hee gaue thankes, he brake the bread, &amp;c.</hi> Fifthly, what the Lorde Ieſus ſaide when hee deliuered the Elements: <hi>Take, eate, &amp;c.</hi> Doeth this maintaine charming? Is there not edifying in this? If you be not voyde of grace, be aſhamed and ſorie for your blaſphemous levvdnes. An other particuler vvhich you reache vnto vs, is a bird of the ſame feather: viz. that the vvorde barely read, and to no other purpoſe then to edifie by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, is not holſome doctrine. For proofe of this groſſe and blaſphemous errour, you vſe three rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The firſt is out of <hi>S. Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothee: The time will come, when they will not ſuffer holſome doctrine: but hauing their eares itching, ſhall after their owne lustes get them an heape of teachers, 2. Tim. 4.3.</hi> Therefore the vvord barely read, and to no other purpoſe then to edifie by reading, is no holſome doctrine. This rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon cleaues together like a broken potſheard. I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie your argument: The Apoſtle in that Chapter commaundeth <hi>Timothee</hi> to attende carefully vpon preaching, &amp;c. His reaſon is: <hi>Many will loath and hate holſome doctrine: they will chuſe ſuch teachers as wil tickle their eares and feede their humours. 2. Tim. 4.3.</hi> Such graceleſſe people were in the time of <hi>Eſay</hi> and <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheas. Eſa. 30. Mich. 2.</hi> Such were they of <hi>Anathoth</hi> in <hi>Ieremies</hi> time <hi>Ier. 11.</hi> Such a one was <hi>Amaziah</hi> of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> Court in <hi>Amos</hi> time. <hi>Am. 7.</hi> Such were in the Churches of <hi>Corinth</hi> and <hi>Galatia</hi> in S. <hi>Pauls</hi> time. Such are they of the fantaſticall crewe in our time, vvhich pike out teachers as rot out of an apple. &amp;c.
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:18219:52"/>Doe you not perceiue M. <hi>Penry,</hi> howe fitly ſaint <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothee</hi> doeth ſerue your turne? you haue bene verie bold with him. You haue vſed the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle as <hi>Cacus</hi> did <hi>Hercules</hi> oxen: therefore I may not thinke much that my writings are depraued by you. Your ſecond reaſon is this: the ſumme of Chriſtes ſermon, pronounced by a Popiſh prieſt, either with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out or within the booke in his darke Latin, is not an edifying worde: therefore the word barely read, and to no other purpoſe then to edifie by reading, is not holſome doctrine. Your Antecedent might haue bene kept in: No man denieth it. It is confeſſed by all of the religion, that the ſcriptures deliuered in an vnknowen tongue doe not edifie. The Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth this notably. <hi>1. Cor. 14. In linguis quas non intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimus ſurdi ſumus, Cic. in Tuſc.</hi> that is, when vve heare a ſtrange language vve are as deafe men.

He that wa<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>teth wood, muſt burne turfe. Your third reaſon is: No learned man vnleſſe he fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoureth charming or Popery, wil ſay that the Lords prayer pronounced by an ignorant man in a ſtrange tongue, or prophaned by a witche, is an edifying word: therefore the word barely read &amp; to no other purpoſe then to edifie by reading, is not holſome doctrine. My anſwere is, I denie your Argument. It is as weake as a ſtaffe of reede. This laſt reaſon is in deede the ſame with the former. I might tell you if I liſted, that your cauſe is poore and naked, when one reaſon muſt be twiſe periured, &amp;c. <hi>verbum ſapienti.</hi> You know the reſt: It came out of your wardroabe.

I thanke you for this, and doe conclude thus againſt you: Therefore the Scripture barely read, and to no other purpoſe then to edifie by reading, is holſome doctrine: for, the Lords prayer is a part of the holy Scripture. Thus at vnwares, he hath ouerthrowen his former fancie. I ſee now of what force the trueth is. It cannot be hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den long. It will breake out at the laſt, as the Sunne thorow a blacke cloude. It hath pleaſed <hi>M. Penry</hi> to deliuer an other ſtrange point of diuinitie in theſe wordes: viz. The word of God vttered, is not an edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying word, vnleſſe it be vttered according to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinance, both in regard of the perſons that vtter the ſame, &amp; the ende wherefore it is vttered. Is not this <hi>(M Penry)</hi> to make the perſon to giue credit to the holy word of God? which poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> is very groſſe and blaſphemous. It is a certaine truth in diuinitie: <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura eſt,</hi>

                     <p>Concerning your conſequent, doe you thinke, that euery one, that can adde an edifying word vnto the Element, may miniſter a Sacrament? it is not ſo: for Paul requireth the wordes of euery Chriſtian (women and all) to be edifying wordes, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.29. euen in common talke. Shall therefore the Element adminiſtred by euery Chriſtian, be a Sacrament? God forbid. And yet euery Chriſtian can adde the ſumme of Chriſts Sermon vnto the Element, in the adminiſtration of the Supper, which if it were ſufficient, as by your reaſon it is, then women, children, &amp;c. Idiots that could not reade might deliuer a Sacrament.</p>

                     <p>The Argument folovves not. I graunt that it is of the ſubſtance of a lavvful and good Miniſter of God to be apt to teach: but it is not of the eſſence of a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter ſimply: for which it is ſufficient to haue the Churches calling. This appeareth clearely in the Magiſtrate. The holy Ghoſt requireth that none ſhoulde be choſen a Magiſtrate, vnleſſe hee were a
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:18219:54"/>man of courage, fearing God, dealing truely, and hating couetouſnes. <hi>Exod. 18.21.</hi> When ſuch are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uanced as defile their handes, either with filthie bribes, as <hi>Felix</hi> did, or with barbarous crueltie, as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bimelech</hi> and <hi>Herode</hi> did, ſhall we ſay that they are no Magiſtrates? I confeſſe, they are not ſingled out by the electors according to Almightie Gods directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in his holy Bible: but they are Magiſtrates not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, and we are commanded by the Lorde to performe all duetie vnto them, <hi>ſaluo officio,</hi> that is, our duetie being reſerued to the higheſt Magiſtrate, which is God himſelfe.</p>

<pb n="106" facs="tcp:18219:55"/>cutte them. I confeſſe freely, that I am very farre from opening either the Church doore to ignorant miniſters, or the pulpit doore to vnskilfull prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chers: which vnskilfull preachers giue Gods religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a greater blowe then the ignorant miniſters: for in ſtead of diuiding the word of trueth aright, they ſpeake at all aduentures, yet very boldely: and as vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skilfull Apothecaries, deliuer <hi>quid pro quo,</hi> chaffe for wheate, and ſtrange fancies for Gods holy trueth. By ſuch abſurde fellowes, many Churches and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent men in this land, haue bene greatly diſquie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the good courſe of religio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> hath bene great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hindered.

<pb n="107" facs="tcp:18219:55"/>I woulde both they &amp; you were diſgraded: and they kept out of the Pulpit, and your writings out of the Preſſe. I hope ſome good will growe by your writings. Firſt, that the Vniuerſities will take better heed, vpon vvhom they beſtow their degrees: Secondly, that the Magiſtrates vvill looke better to the Printing houſes. By the fourth ſort of ſuppoſed Miniſters vvhich you vvrite of, I knovve not vvhom you meane. I could gheſſe ſhrevvdly, but I vvil not, becauſe I vvill not miſconſtrue you.

Secondly, whoſoeuer bringeth faith and repentance with him to the holy Table, is a worthy receiuer, though the Miniſter be an idole. The vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthines
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:18219:57"/>worthines of the Miniſter hurtes himſelfe, but not the godly communicant. Otherwiſe the holy Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets were vnworthie receiuers, which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with idole prieſtes. Thirdly, you adde that a bleſſing may be receiued, and yet pollution in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuer, <hi>2. Chr. 30. Nomb. 9.</hi> This is, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, iuſt from the corner to the ſtaffe, that I may vſe your owne phraſe. Do you confute on this faſhion? You ſhould haue proued that the worthy partaker of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment receiuing a bleſſing, receiued pollution, (that is ſinne,) by partaking the Sacrament. Becauſe this paſſeth your skill, you fight with your ſhadowe, and tell me, that a bleſſing may be receiued, and yet pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution in the receiuer: That is to ſay, that pollution is brought of the Communicant to the holy table, not receiued from or by the holy Sacrament. This makes nothing againſt that which I haue written. Onely it bewrayeth your ignorance. All godly men confeſſe, that pollution, that is ſinne, is in the holieſt Communicants: I meane, <hi>peccatum habitans non reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nans,</hi> That is, ſinne dwelleth in Gods ſeruants, but hath not dominion ouer them. The Patriarks, Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rites, Prophets, Apoſtles, had this pollution. They could not ſhake it off in this life: the beſt of them had their wants. Only our Sauiour Chriſt was cleare of ſinne. You and I agree, I am ſure, in this particuler. If I ſhould aske you, how you proue pollution, that is, ſinne, to bee in the receiuer of the holy Sacrament, you woulde referre mee to your quotations in the booke of <hi>Chronicles</hi> and <hi>Numbers.</hi> Giue me leaue to examine your quotations a litle. Your firſt place is in the <hi>Chronicles.</hi> The words of the text are theſe: <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there were many in the Congregation that were not
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:18219:58"/>ſanctified, therfore the Leuites had the charge of the killing of the Paſſeouer, for all that were not cleane, to ſanctifie it to the Lord. For a multitude of the people, euen a multitude of Ephraim, and Manaſſeh, Iſſachar and Zebulun, had not cleanſed themſelues, yet did cate the Paſſeouer, but not as it was written: Wherefore Hezekiah prayed for them, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The good Lord be mercifull toward him, that prepareth his whole heart to ſeeke the Lord God, the God of his fathers, though hee be not cleanſed, according to the purification of the Sanctuarie. 2. Chr. 30.17, 18, 19.</hi> All that you can proue by this place, is, that they of <hi>Ephraim, Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh, Iſſachar, &amp;c.</hi> were vncleane according to the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the Sanctuarie, that is, touching ſome ceremonie of <hi>Moſes</hi> law: for which vncleannes they were diſpenſed with. Your ſeconde place is in the booke of <hi>Numbers.</hi> The wordes of the text are theſe: <hi>And certaine men were defiled by a dead man that they might not keepe the Paſſeouer the ſame day: and they came before Moſes and before Aaron the ſame day. And thoſe men ſaid vnto him, we are defiled by a dead man: wherefore are wee kept backe that wee may not offer an offering vnto the Lord, in the time thereunto appointed, among the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael? Then Moſes ſaid vnto them, ſtand ſtil, and I wil heare what the Lord will co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mande concerning you. And the Lord ſpake vnto Moſes, ſaying, Speake vnto the childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of Iſrael, &amp; ſay, if any among you, or of your poſteritie, ſhall he vncleane by the reaſon of a corps, or bee in a long iourney, he ſhall keepe the Paſſeouer vnto the Lord. Nu. 9. ver. 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.</hi> All that you can gather of this place, is, that theſe me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> which were defiled by reaſon of a dead ma<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, did not celebrate the paſſeouer before the Lordes pleaſure vvas knowen. You cannot conclude either of this place in the booke of <hi>Numbers,</hi> or of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:18219:58"/>place in the <hi>Chronicles,</hi> that ſinne was in theſe, which offered themſelues to the Paſſeouer. I doubt not but that theſe men had pollution, that is, ſinne, in them: But I am ſure theſe places neither doe nor can prooue it: for you may not reaſon thus: They of <hi>Ephraim</hi> &amp;c. were vncleane touching ſome cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of <hi>Moſes</hi> lawe, therefore they were ſinners. If you do, I deny your argument. It is a certaine truth in diuinitie, that not euery legall pollution was ioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with ſinne: My reaſon is, the touching of a dead body, was a legall vncleanneſſe. If it were a ſinne, then the buriall of the dead, which is a Chriſtian duetie, and a worke of mercy, ſhould be ſinne. Thus, you haue taken paines, but to litle purpoſe. You haue ſhotte, I confeſſe: but, <hi>nec coelum nec terram at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingis,</hi> you are many ſcores wide.</p>

                     <p>I deny your Antecedent: My reaſons are: firſt, there was a nullitie before God of <hi>Caiphas</hi> prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood: for he entred by money, and the prieſthood was diuided betweene him and <hi>Annas,</hi> againſt the Lords order. <hi>Calu. Luc. 3.</hi> yet <hi>Caiphas</hi> is called the high Prieſt by the Euangeliſts. <hi>Matth. 26. Iohn 18.</hi> Secondly, there was a nullitie before God, of the miniſtery of ſome in <hi>Philippi,</hi> which preached Chriſt of contention, and to adde more affliction to <hi>Paules</hi> bandes. <hi>Philip. Chap. 1.15, 16.</hi> But theſe are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compted miniſters by the Apoſtle <hi>verſe 15.18.</hi> If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſhall deny, that there was a nullitie before God of their miniſterie, I proue it thus: they had not an inward calling.

                     <p>Concerning the Nullitie of our readers miniſtery, we are to know, that there is a nullitie of a miniſtery before God, eyther becauſe the action proceedeth from a corrupt miniſter, as <hi>Pſalm.</hi> 50.16. whome God woulde not haue to deale with his ordinances, or from a corrupt and euill mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie, which is none of Gods ordinance. The action of the former is ſubſtantiall in regard of vs: of the latter wee knowe no ſubſtance it can haue. Of the former there is a nullitie onely in the ſight of God: of the latter, both in reſpect of the Lorde and alſo of vs. The nullitie of our readers miniſterie is of this latter ſort, namely ſuch as we ought in no wiſe to account a miniſtery. Whereas therefore you grant that there is a nul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie of our readers miniſtery before God, and yet affirme them to be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, you ſwarue from the point, and ſo your anſwere is nothing to the purpoſe, but a deſiring of the queſtion, after your vſuall manner. As <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> then, and the reſt of the ſleepy dogges, againſt whome the prophet cryeth out, were wicked men, God would not haue ſuch to bee his mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: hither referre <hi>Eſay</hi> 1.13. But as they had the miniſtery which God allowed of, they were miniſters vnto the people. This miniſtery, our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders want, therefore they can be no miniſters, neyther in reſpect of the Lorde, nor of the Church. <hi>Shemaiah</hi> was a wicked man, and a falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, ſo were the reſt of his ſtampe. The Lord deteſted both them and their miniſterie. <hi>Zephaniah</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> high prieſts with their company, were as wicked as any of the falſe prophets, the Lorde abhorred the men, but their miniſtery was his ordinance. Hence. M <hi>Some,</hi> it followeth, that neither the briberie of your <hi>Caiphas,</hi> nor the blindneſſe of your ignorant Leuites, can make ſuch a nullitie of their prietſhood, as they ſhould bee no prieſtes vnto the people. And therefore great reaſon why the parents of our ſauiour, and the reſt of the godly wherof you ſpeake, <hi>Page</hi> 28. 29. ſhould not leaue the ſeruice of God for the pollution of the prieſts. <hi>Eſay</hi> ſpeaketh againſt blind watchmen, <hi>Chap.</hi> 56.10. but <hi>chap.</hi> 42.19, 20. it ſhall appeare, that they ſawe many things, but kept them not. I pray you conferre the places, and it can neuer be prooued, that any of them were ſo blinde, as they could not declare by preaching the generall vſe of the ſacrifices and ceremonies. Their wants might be many, but not like the inſufficiency of our readers. Be it they were as inſufficient, yet their miniſterie might be allowable.</p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="tcp:18219:63"/>
                     <p>Your anſwere conſiſteth of ſeuerall branches. I will handle the chiefeſt of them ſo briefly as I can. Your firſt branch is, that the miniſtery of the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Leuiticall prieſts is allowed of God: but that the outward calling of our vnpreaching miniſters, is not allowed of God. Of this you conclude, that the Leuitical prieſts were miniſters vnto the people (and conſequently that <hi>Ioſeph</hi> and the virgine <hi>Mary</hi> were not polluted by their Sacrifices) but that our vnpreaching miniſters are not ſo to vs. If the action of ignorant miniſters be, as you write, not ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all in regard of vs: then you muſt deny (which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you did not) that any Sacrament either was or is deliuered by them. I would fayne know why the miniſtery of the ignorant Leuites ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not the miniſterie of ignorant miniſters. I confeſſe freely, that I take their caſes to be like, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer you mince &amp; ſhift the matter. But Iſmel your meaning: <hi>Latet anguis in herba,</hi> there is a padde in the ſtrawe. To proceede, you ſtand very much vpon the outward calling of the miniſters in our Church. If you repell the vnpreaching miniſter for his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, you can not allowe the ignorant Leuiticall prieſts. If you repell the vnpreaching miniſter, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of his outward calling, you may by the like reaſon diſcharge the worthieſt miniſters in this land of the holy miniſterie: for all haue one and the ſame externall calling in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> If you be ſo affected, the next newes we ſhall heare of you, will be that you ſhake hands with our Anabaptiſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call recuſants, <hi>Vno abſurdo dato, multa conſequuntur.</hi> that is, Euery abſurditie hath many attendantes.
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:18219:64"/>The ſecond branch of your anſwere, is, a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, or rather preferring the ignorant Leuiticall prieſts before our ignorant miniſters. <hi>Nobile par:</hi> neither barrell better herring. I muſt a little while examine this ſecond braunch of yours. You tell vs that the wants of the Leuiticall prieſtes might bee many, but not like the inſufficiencie of our readers. For proofe of this, you quote two textes in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Eſay.</hi> The firſt is contained in theſe wordes: <hi>Their watchmen are all blind: they haue no knowledge: they are all dumbe dogges: they cannot barke: they lie and ſleepe, and delight in ſleeping. Eſa. 56.</hi> Will you gather of theſe vvordes, that the ignorant Leuiticall prieſts were more learned and better furniſhed then the ignorant miniſters? The prophet <hi>Eſay</hi> ſaieth that theſe Leuitical prieſts had neither <hi>rem</hi> nor <hi>ſpem,</hi> that is, that they were woe begone. If you woulde ſtudy ſeuen yeeres, you could not deuiſe to ſpeake worſe of the moſt ignorant miniſters in our Church. The ſecond place of the Prophet hath theſe words: <hi>Who is blinde but my ſeruant? or deafe as my meſſenger that I ſent? who is blinde as the perfit, and blind as the Lords ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants? Seeing many thinges but thou keepeſt them not? opening the eares, but hee heareth not? Eſay 42. Eſay</hi> in theſe verſes calleth the Leuiticall prieſts blinde and deafe, not in body, but in heart, becauſe they did ſee and heare Gods iudgements with their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dilie eyes and eares, and did not obſerue them with the eyes and eares of their hearts. You can not conclude of this place, that the ignorant Leui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall prieſts were deeper clerkes then the ignorant miniſters in the Church of <hi>England.</hi> The thirde branch of your anſwere is, that the miniſtery of <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi>
                        <pb n="125" facs="tcp:18219:64"/>was the Lords ordinance. I deny it, and do diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from you in this. My reaſon is: <hi>Caiphas</hi> had not the high prieſhood alone, therefore his high prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was not the Lords ordinance. The Antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent is manifeſt, for <hi>Annas</hi> and <hi>Caiphas</hi> were high prieſts together, <hi>Luk. 3.</hi> The argument followes: for the Lords ordinance was that onely one ſhould be the high prieſt. <hi>Calu: Luk. 3.2.</hi> You ſay nothing here of the contentious miniſters of <hi>Philippi.</hi> You take and leaue at your pleaſure. It pleaſeth you to cal <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas,</hi> my <hi>Caiphas,</hi> and the blinde Leuites, my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Leuites. I ſhould bee ſpedde, I perceiue, if I would receiue al that you caſt vpon me. Before, you did lade me with reuerence: now, you throwe <hi>Cai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phas</hi> and the ignorant Leuites, as cobble ſtones, at me. You are very liberall: but I refuſe your gheſts: I diſclaime them, and returne them to your ſelfe. You are much fitter to entertaine them, then I: for, you haue magnified <hi>Caiphas</hi> miniſtery, &amp; are a hot plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der for the ignorant Leuiticall prieſts. That appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth in your wordes which follow.</p>

<pb n="126" facs="tcp:18219:65"/>receiued the Sacraments at their handes, were not polluted. If they were not polluted, what ſay you to theſe arguments? viz. The Sacrament may not be receiued at his handes, which wanteth outward cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: therefore not at his hands which is deſtitute of the inwarde graces. <hi>I. Pen.</hi> Againe, we haue no war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to receiue an extraordinarie Sacrament: But that which is adminiſtred by ignorant Miniſters is an extraordinarie Sacrament, if it be any: therefore we haue no warrant to receiue it. You know, I am ſure, the father of theſe two arguments. They came out of your owne Mint. Secondly, if your firſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be good, then a corrupt externall approbation made them lawful Prieſts, which had not an inward calling, that is, ſufficiencie of gifts, &amp;c. If you denie the externall approbation of the ignorant Leuites, to be a corrupt approbation, I proue it thus. It was a breach of Gods owne order, therefore it was a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt approbation.

Num. 3.10.</hi> My anſwere is: No trial of giftes in <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp; his ſonnes was needfull at the firſt: for Almightie God did furniſh the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.

<pb n="127" facs="tcp:18219:65"/>himſelfe: <hi>My couenant was with him of life and peace and I gaue him feare, and he feared me, and was afraide before my Name. The Lawe of trueth was in his mouth and there was no iniquitie found in his lippes: he walked with me in peace and equitie, and did turne many away from iniquitie. Mal. 2.5, 6.</hi> God did neuer call any to the holy Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, but he gaue them giftes fit for that function. I haue proued this point in the beginning of this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. To thinke otherwiſe of his Maieſtie, is great wickednes. I hope, you will not reaſon thus: There was no commandement co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cerning the trial of gifts in <hi>Aaron</hi> and his ſonnes at the firſt: therefore there was neuer any triall afterward of giftes in <hi>Aarons</hi> po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritie.

My reaſon is, If euery one of <hi>Aarons</hi> poſteritie, how vnfit ſo euer, might enter into the Prieſtes office by the Lords warrant, Almightie God might be iuſtly charged to haue had very little care, either of his owne honor, or of the Church of the Iſraelites.

                        <hi>Acts. 21.26.</hi> Your laſt reaſon ſerues very fitly for my purpoſe: therefore I will vſe it as a ſworde to cut in pieces ſome of your fancies. <hi>Paul,</hi> you ſay, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated after his conuerſion with thoſe prieſts, that were as vnlearned as euer any, &amp; was not polluted. Of this I conclude: therefore they which receiue the Sacraments at the hands of vnpreaching Miniſters, are not polluted. My reaſon is: The ignorant Leuites and ignorant Miniſters agree <hi>in eodem tertio,</hi> that is, in ignorance. But <hi>M. Penry</hi> replies that an argument from the Leuiticall prieſthoode, is not forcible for vnpreaching Miniſters. To proue this, he vſeth two reaſons. The firſt is: our readers Miniſterie is not a Leuiticall Miniſterie, therefore an Argument from the Leuitical Prieſthood, is not forcible for vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Miniſters. My anſwere is: I graunt that no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie in theſe dayes is a Leuiticall miniſterie: for, the date of that miniſterie is out long ago. But I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie your Argument. My reaſon is: An argument is and may be forcibly drawen from one thing to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which are vnmatchable. All Logicians con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſe that ſimilitudes are of things which differ. Eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry meane Sophiſter in the Vniuerſitie knoweth it. It is very like that you haue forgotte<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it. Such trifles are too baſe for your great ſpirits. Your ſecond reaſon is: The corrupt approbation of vnpreaching Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters (ſo you name the beſt outward calling they can haue of the Church) is not ſo forcible to make them Miniſters, as was the ordinance of God to make the ſonnes of <hi>Aaron</hi> ſacrificing at <hi>Ieruſale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>,</hi> to be prieſtes: therefore an Argument from the Leuiticall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is not forcible for vnpreaching Miniſters. My anſwer is: I deny your antecedent, and do adde this:
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:18219:67"/>firſt, that it is as lawfull (that is to ſay, vtterly vnlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full) to make vnfit Miniſters now, as it was before to make vnfit prieſtes. Secondly, that it was not Gods pleaſure, that all the poſteritie of <hi>Aaron</hi> without ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, that is, tagge and ragge, ſhoulde be admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the holy prieſthood. For neither you, nor any man aliue, may reaſon thus: The Leuiticall prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoode muſt reſt in the tribe of <hi>Leui:</hi> therefore euery one of that tribe (though vnfit for that holy functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) was to be admitted to the prieſthoode. You might very ſoundly haue diſputed thus: The Leuiticall prieſthood muſt be kept within the compaſſe of the tribe of <hi>Leui,</hi> by Gods expreſſe commaundement, <hi>Num. 3.</hi> therefore no ſtranger might come neere the Lords altar. You call the beſt outward calling in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> a corrupt approbation. If you meane it is corrupt in admitting ignorant men to the holy Miniſterie, ſo was the ordeyning of ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t <hi>Leuites</hi> at <hi>Ieruſalem.</hi> If you meane that the beſt out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling in the Church of <hi>Engla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>d,</hi> is ſimply cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt, that is, none at al, though ſufficient men be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, I deteſt your Anabaptiſtical fancie: for then the worthieſt Diuines in this land, are no Miniſters. Beſides, it is confeſſed of all famous &amp; learned men, that Gods Church is not neceſſarily tied in all pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and times, to one forme in the externall calling of the miniſters.</p>

                     <p>If by ſubſtantial Miniſters, you meane ſuch as are furniſhed with giftes in good meaſure, it is the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar office of God to make ſuch, either miraculouſly, as hee did the Prophets and many in the Primitiue Church: or by bleſſing mens godly ſtudies, as in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and our times. It paſſeth the Churches reach, by any externall calling to make men furniſhed mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, which before the external allowance, were not furniſhed by God himſelfe: therefore to bee of the line of <hi>Aaron,</hi> did make the ignorant <hi>Leuites</hi> no more to be ſubſtantiall prieſtes, then the externall calling nowe, doeth make ignorant men to be ſubſtantiall Miniſters. The ſumme of your reaſons may be ſhut
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:18219:68"/>vp briefly in this argument: All may be capable, as you ſay, of the outward allowance: therefore the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling of the Church makes not a Miniſter to vs, vnleſſe he haue the inward. Your antecedent is a ſpeciall one. If you were not ſtrangely caried, ſome branches of it might haue bene kept in. I truſt you do not condemne a preſcript liturgie in the Church of God. If you do, all the reformed Churches diſſent from you, and their practiſe doeth apparantly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute you. But I leaue that, and denie your argument. My reaſons are: firſt, the ignorant <hi>Leuites</hi> had an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward calling, but not an inward: yet they were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful prieſts by your owne confeſſion. Secondly, <hi>Iudas</hi> was called outwardly, but not inwardly: yet he was an Apoſtle. Laſtly, the Apoſtle chargeth <hi>Timothee</hi> not to lay handes raſhly on any, <hi>1. Tim. 5.</hi> therefore the outwarde allowance is more then you accompt of. My reaſon from the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tentious Miniſters of <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippi, &amp;c.</hi> was a very ſure one, &amp; did ouerthrow your fancie.

The mention of them hath not troubled the godly Reader at al, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not impudently, as you giue out very ſawcily.

                     <p>You demaund what I thinke of this propoſition. Surely my iudgement is, that it is altogether without ſenſe, and ouerthroweth it ſelfe: for, it is as if you ſayd, he of whoſe faith there is a nullitie before God, though he be aſſured of his ſaluation, is not to be accompted a faithfull man. Why? to be aſſured of ſaluation, and to haue a nullitie of faith before God, can not ſtand together. No more can the outward calling of the magiſtracy, ſtand with the nullitie thereof. For the outward calling maketh a ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiall magiſtrate. But, M. <hi>Some,</hi> where is that reaſon which you could preſſe ſo farre? is this it? they of whoſe magiſtracy there is a nullity before God, ought not to be accompted magiſtrates.

Of this I gather, that you holde, that one which is no miniſter, may deliuer a Sacrament: for, an extraordinarie Sacrament is a Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t. If I would enter into your vaine, I might ſet downe theſe conſequents: viz. that bargemen,
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:18219:72"/>children, women, Idiots &amp;c. in your iudgement, may adminiſter an extraordinary Sacrament. Your other errour is, that the holy Supper &amp;c. is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Sacrament, when it is deliuered pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately by a miniſter. I am not of your iudgement in this: I am of M. <hi>Caluines:</hi> therefore I ſet downe this propoſition: viz. that it is lawfull to adminiſter the holy Supper in a particuler houſe, if ſome cautions and circumſtances be obſerued. The reaſons do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare a litle after. It pleaſeth you to ſay, that as you neuer denied, ſo you neuer affirmed it to be a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which is deliuered by an vnpreaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. A worthy reſolution. If you denie not that it is a Sacrament, &amp;c. you doe affirme it. For, not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is to affirme.

                     <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Morney,</hi> doeth anſwere thus: As our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſaries make a difference betweene the Church and the people, ſnatching the name of the Church onely to the Prelates, which ſhould bee common to all Chriſtians: ſo, wee likewiſe doe well put a diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, betweene the people cleauing to the Church of Rome, and the faction of Antichriſt: betweene them who liue vnder the Popedome, and the vphol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and mainteiners of the Pope: betweene the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaunters, and thoſe that are inchaunted: betweene the Phariſees, whom Chriſt calleth a generation of vipers, and the poore ſicke woman, whom he called the very daughter of Abraham. We ſay, that among the poore people, which was ſo long time deceiued vnder the darkeneſſe of Antichriſt, there was a part of the body of the viſible Church: But that the Pope
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:18219:78"/>and his mainteiners, are the botch of the plague in it, which ſtifleth &amp; choketh it as much as it can, &amp;c. And a little after, &amp;c. We knowe that the moſt part of the people, were ignorant of thoſe peſtilent doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines which the Schoolemen left in writing, that is to ſay, of the principall blaſphemies of the Papacie: alſo, that the more part did neuer beleeue, that they could merite euerlaſting life by their owne workes, whatſoeuer men preached thereof. Againe, albeit that through cuſtome and ignorance they went to Saints and Images, and frequented Maſſes and Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimages: yet notwithſtanding in their conflicts of death, they alwayes principally claue to the croſſe of Ieſus Chriſt. We haue an example of S. <hi>Barnard</hi> himſelfe, and we haue ſeene many more in our time. Saint <hi>Barnard</hi> in certaine places ſauoureth of the contagion of his time, as it was hard hee ſhould doe otherwiſe. But ſee his refuge when hee was tempted of the deuill, in his laſt dayes: <hi>I confeſſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that I am not worthie of it. I knowe that I can not by mine owne workes obteine the kingdome of heauen. But my Lord hath obteyned it by a double right: by inheritance from the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and by the merite of his paſsion. Nowe he is contented with the one, and giueth me the other. And when I attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute it to my ſelfe, by the gift which he hath made vnto me thereof, I cannot be confounded.</hi> And in another place: <hi>My merite is the mercie of the Lord. And I am not poore in merites, becauſe hee is rich in his mercies: I haue greatly ſinned, but I will comfort my ſelfe in the ſtripes of my Lord.</hi> Euen ſo likewiſe, we aſſure our ſelues in the mercy of God, that a great number helde the fou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>dation in Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whereof the Apoſtle ſpeaketh, albeit An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichriſt ſhooke it, &amp; as it were, endeuoured to ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne

                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Verie Miniſter muſt bee at the leaſt by profeſſion, a member of the true Church. No Popiſh Prieſt is by profeſſion a member of the true Church. Therefore no Popiſh Prieſt is a miniſter.</p>
                  <p>Euery miniſter hath an office within the body of the Church. No popiſh prieſt hath an office within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Church. Therfore no popiſh prieſt is a miniſter.</p>
                  <p>The propoſitions or firſt part of both theſe reaſons are ſet down euident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and plainly by the wiſdome of God, in theſe words. For as we haue many members in one body, and all members haue not one office: ſo we being many, are one body in Chriſt, and euery one anothers members, ſeeing then that we haue gifts that are diuers. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>The place ſheweth cleerely, that whoſoeuer is not a member, is not of the bodie, if not of the bodie, then no miniſter. Againe, whoſoeuer is no member, he hath no office in the bodie: if no office, no miniſter. He that ſhould obiect that in this place is ment a member of the bodie, by election in the ſecrete counſell of God, and not in the acknowledgement of the Church by profeſſion, would not deſerue the anſwering. Becauſe it is voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and not election, that maketh ſuch a member in the Church as may haue an office therein: of which ſort the Apoſtle ſpeaketh in this place. By vocation, I meane that whereof the holy Ghoſt ſpeaketh, where it is ſayde, Many are called, but fewe are choſen: neither can any man denie him to be a member of the Church, which by outward profeſſion ſubmitteth himſelfe vnto true religion, and ſuch are the members, whereof the Apoſtle ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth: namely ſuch as are members in the iudgement of the Church. Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das was a member in the iudgement of the Church, though not belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to election. A further proofe of the propoſitions you ſhall find 1. Cor. 12.26.28. Hee was no prieſt in the olde Teſtament, that was not a Iewe by profeſſion: yea, and of the line of Aaron too: and ſhall he be accounted a miniſter among vs, that is a ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ger from the profeſſion of the trueth, and a profeſſed Idolater? Iſhmael and Eſau were circumciſed, and the ſonnes of thoſe fathers vnto whome the couenant was made: Euen I will bee thy God, and the God of thy ſeed. They and their poſterities fell from true re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion: well, admit that the profanation of circumciſion had ſtill continued in their houſes: yet a man ſupplying the place of a prieſt among them, was no prieſt in deed, though he ten thouſand times profaned circumciſion, &amp; would brag neuer ſo often, that he worſhipped after his Idolatrous maner, no other God, but the God of his father Abraham, and ſware onely by the feare of his father Iſaac. The reaſon hereof is, becauſe that euery prieſt vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:18219:82"/>the law, muſt be an Iſraelite by profeſſion, that is, a member of the true Church, neither could any of the godly aſſure themſelues, that an Edomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh prieſt admiſtred true circumciſion according to the ſubſtance. Now I reckon of a popiſh prieſt no otherwiſe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> I would haue done of an Iſmae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litiſh or Edomitiſh circumciſer: the profanation of that ſeale of the coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, ſtill continuing in mount Seir.</p>

                     <p>Your Maior propoſitions in your two firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are. viz. Euery Miniſter muſt bee at the leaſt by profeſſion a member of the true Church. And, euery Miniſter hath an office within the body of the Church. My anſwere is, that your Maior propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the proofe of them out of the 12. to the <hi>Rom.</hi> are true, if you giue them this ſenſe, viz. that euery lawfull and good Miniſter of God is by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion a member and hath an office within the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the ſound Church. If you vnderſtand your Maior propoſitions otherwiſe, I deny them: my rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is: Excommunicated heretiques which admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter true baptiſme out of the Church, had a cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling though a faultie one: and yet theſe heretiques, neither were me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bers, nor had any office in the true Church. That <hi>Iudas</hi> was a veſſel of wrath, and yet an Apoſtle and a member of the Church in the iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, I make no queſtion. The caſe of many hypocrites, hath &amp; may be ſuch for repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation and miniſterie, though not for Apoſtleſhip. That which I like of in this Treatiſe of yours, I will either alow by ſome ſhort ſpeach, or elſe paſſe ouer with ſilence. Cauiling and wrangling, become not ſuch as profeſſe and loue the Religion. If none may be a Miniſter in Gods Church by Gods order, but ſuch as are members, that is, engraffed into Gods Church: it is a good conſequent that none in the
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:18219:83"/>time of the Law, might be a Leuiticall Prieſt which was vncircumciſed. Which point you dealt very ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gly in before. It is true that none might be a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiticall prieſt, which was not a Iewe by profeſſion, and of the line of <hi>Aaron:</hi> but yet not euery one of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rons</hi> line (if he were vnfit for that holy functio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>) might be admitted to the <hi>Leuiticall</hi> prieſthood, as you gaue out before very abſurdly. No popiſh Prieſt (as hee is a popiſh Prieſt) is accompted a Miniſter in our Church. If you thinke otherwiſe, you thinke amiſſe: for I can aſſure you, that none which haue bene po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſtes, either did or doe adminiſter in our Church without the allowance of our Church. I confeſſe, they receiue not impoſition of handes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine either in our Church or in other reformed Churches. If Circumciſion was amongſt the <hi>Iſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites</hi> and <hi>Edomites</hi> (as you write and I affirme) then a Sacrament was amongſt them. I pray you remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber this. The Prieſtes of <hi>Idumea,</hi> I graunt, were not Prieſtes in deede, that is, they were not lawfull and good Miniſters of God: for they had no lawfull cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: yet they had a calling though a faultie one: Otherwiſe Circumciſion adminiſtred by them had bene no Sacrament. That which decemeth you, is, that you do not diſtinguiſh betweene a lawfull and good Miniſter of God, and a Miniſter: betweene a lawfull calling, and a calling, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>Whereas in the aſſumption or ſecond part of both the reaſons, I deny popiſh Prieſts to be members of the Church: my meaning is not that there are none of the elect, within the body of Popery, whom the Lord may cal in his good time: For I woulde not deny this vnto Mahometiſme, or that there are not left in Popery certaine rubiſhes &amp; ſteps of true Religion, for this difference I make betwene them and other Infidels, though the Iewes
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:18219:83"/>alſo may claime this vnto themſelues. But I meane that the Popiſh religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is ſuch a religion as whoſoeuer liueth &amp; dieth in the profeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: he liueth and dieth out of the Church, where ſaluation is not poſſibly to be had, for any thing that is made knowen vnto man. Whence it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily foloweth, that in Popery there is no Church. If it be obiected that the Papiſts are within the Couenant, inaſmuch as long ſince they profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the trueth: Mine anſwere will be, that Popery was neuer the trueth as yet, that no Papiſt in that hee was a Papiſt, euer profeſſed the trueth, and that God made no Couenant with profeſſed Idolaters, as all Papiſts are.</p>

                     <p>Your Minor propoſitions in your two firſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are, viz. No popiſh prieſt is by profeſſion a me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ber of the church: And, No popiſh prieſt hath an office within the bodie of the Church. My anſwer is: If by <hi>(church)</hi> in your Minor propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s you meane a ſound Church: I grant that no popiſh prieſt (as he is a popiſh prieſt and a profeſſed papiſt) is either a member by profeſſion, or hath an office within the bodie of the Church. If by <hi>(Church)</hi> you meane an vnſound Church: My anſwer is, that a popiſh prieſt is a member &amp; hath an office within the body of the church. My reaſon is: the popiſh church is a church, though an vnſound church. For proofe of this I haue vſed diuerſe reaſons in this Treatiſe. I referre you to them. If they wil not downe with you, you muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fute the ſeuerall writings of <hi>Caluine</hi> in his Inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, Commentaries and Epiſtles, &amp; of other famous men, and condemne the iudgement of all the refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med churches. If your ſtomacke ſerue you, you haue matter inough to work on, &amp; more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> you were wel aware of. That ſteps of true Religion remaine in the Popiſh Church, it is manifeſt: for God preſerued in that Church <hi>verbum ſuum &amp; baptiſmum,</hi> That is, his Word and Baptiſme: <hi>Beza in Annot. Matt. 23.2.</hi> Yea, we of the Religion haue receiued many good things
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:18219:84"/>from the papiſts, as the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> did the Arke fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the <hi>Philiſtines.</hi> I graunt that the <hi>Iewes</hi> haue many good things amo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gſt them: yet there is great difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twene <hi>Iewes</hi> &amp; papiſts. The papiſt receiueth the new Teſtame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t: ſo doth not the Iew. The papiſt doth not vſe circu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ciſion, becauſe the date of it is out, but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme which is an engraffing into Chriſt. The Iewe retaineth circumciſion &amp; doth not admit baptiſme. That the papiſts are not altogether aliens fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> Gods couenant, I haue ſhewed before, and doe reſt in <hi>M. Caluines</hi> iudgement, for that point. You write that poperie was neuer the trueth as yet. If you meane that all poperie was neuer the trueth as yet, I agree with you. If you meane that no part in poperie was euer the trueth as yet, you erre groſſely, and are refuted by your owne words, which are, that there are certaine ſteppes of true religion in poperie. You giue out that no papiſt (in that he was a papiſt) euer profeſſed the trueth. My anſwere is, that they did and doe erre in very many things, but yet they did and doe profeſſe ſome trueth: and I doubt not, but that many which liued and died in the time of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh darkeneſſe, died Gods ſeruants. If you thinke that a man being wide in many things, is wide in all things: then becauſe you, M. <hi>Penry,</hi> haue deliuered manie blaſphemous, Anabaptiſticall, and other er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, I might iuſtly conclude that you hold no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſoundly: but I wil not offer you ſuch meaſure. If I did, I ſhould deale abſurdly with you. Howe profeſſed papiſts are Idolaters, appeareth in my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond propoſition, which is newly added to my for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer treatiſe. Thither I referre you.</p>

                     <p>Antichriſt I grant ſhould ſit as God in the temple of God, but it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:18219:84"/>the temple of God, ſince he planted his peſtilent chaire therein. Pope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie in deed hath inuaded the ſeates and poſſeſſions of true religion, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan firſt where the trueth was profeſſed. For the myſterie of iniquitie firſt appeared within the Church, and not elſe-where, where true religion flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed, and not among the heathen: neither could he bee that aduerſarie, whoſe beginning ſhoulde bee in Paganiſme. But although Poperie tooke roote in the ſoyle where the true Churche was planted: yet it ſo grewe there, that it ſtill continued to be the ſynagogue of Satan, and could neuer as yet be the Church of God: howſoeuer it hath ouergrowen the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion thereof. And what though their fathers, who now are Papiſts, were within the couenant, as profeſſing true religion: ſhall it therefore followe that their Idolatrous ſonnes ſhould be ſo too? If they returne the Lord hath mercie in ſtore for them I denie not. But what is there in this poynt ſaide for the Papiſts, which the Iewes cannot with farre more ſhewe of reaſon pretend for themſelues? The profaning of Baptiſme among the Papiſtes can make them no more be within the Church, then the continuance of the profanation of Circumciſion among the Iſhmaelites and Edomites could keepe them vnder the couenant. And why ſhould popiſh Baptiſme any more tye the Lords couenant to an Idolatrous race, then an Iſhmaeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh or Edomitiſh cutting off of the foreskinne, linke him to be the God of thoſe adulterous generations? Oh but the Lord himſelfe hath ſaid, in Iſaak ſhall thy ſeede be called, and Iaacob haue I loued, and hated Eſau. Why the ſame Lorde in reſpect of his reuealed will, for with his ſecrete election men muſt not meddle, hath ſayd, the profeſſours of true religion do I loue, but the Idolatrous papiſts my ſoule abhorreth: It will be here demaunded whether I make no more account of popiſh baptiſme, then of an Edomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh circumciſion, I ſee no reaſon why I ſhould. For a circumciſed Edomite being receiued, to be a true worſhipper at Ieruſalem, ſhould as well content himſelfe with that circumciſion (circumciſion being not a thing inuented by man, or done in reſpect of man, but ordeyned by the Lord, and done in regard of the couenant made vnto Abraham) as we doe with popiſh bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, which is not called in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>And yet that which is ſpoken concerning the profeſſion of the trueth, by the forefathers, is not altogether true in popery: for there bee many large regions nowe profeſſing poperie, where not ſo much as the name of Chriſt was heard, vntill they were become groſſely popiſh. So that their firſt ſtep was out of paganiſme vnto poperie. And this is the eſtate of all thoſe poore oppreſſed vaſſals the weſt Indians, who now in great numbers profeſſe Romiſh Idolatrie. For at ſuch time as the Spanyard inuading their land brought vpon them the moſt miſerable ſlauerie of the body &amp; ſoule, that are vpon any people vnder heauen, they had not ſo much as hearde whether there was any Chriſt, but were moſt heathniſh, and ſenceleſſe Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters, as may appeare by the popiſh hyſtoriographers themſelues, who wrote the ſtories of thoſe tymes: And therefore (to omit, whoſe poſterities many of the nations within Europe are, that haue refuſed the light of the Goſpel) though it were granted, that the reſt of the popiſh rable were with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:18219:85"/>in the couenant: yet theſe miſerable heathen papiſts, can be ſaid to be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no couenant, but that which is made vnto popery and paganiſme. I hope M. <hi>Some,</hi> howſoeuer you may be perſwaded, that other popiſh ſhaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings can deliuer a ſacrament, yet that you will doubt, whether any man could be aſſured to receyue thoſe holy ſeales at the hands of the heathen maſſemongers remayning in Cuba, Hyſpaniola, Mexico, or any other the Eaſterne parts.</p>
                     <p>And thus much concerning the aſſumption. I am not ignorant that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous and worthie men, haue otherwiſe written concerning the popiſh Church, and therefore I am not to be preſſed with their authoritie.</p>

                     <p>If your writings were as ſounde as they are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurde, they would giue many times great aduantage to the Papiſt, Anabaptiſt, &amp;c. If the popiſh church was neuer the temple of God, ſince <hi>Antichriſt</hi> plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his peſtilent chaire there, then in your iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Pope is not <hi>Antichriſt:</hi> for <hi>Antichriſt</hi> doth and muſt ſit in the Temple of God, that is, in the Church of God. I haue handled this argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. I reſt in that I haue written there. You ſay that a circumciſed <hi>Edomite</hi> being receiued into the Church of <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> ſhould content himſelfe with his circumciſion in <hi>Idumea,</hi> becauſe circumciſion was the Lords ordinance &amp;c. I agree with you in this. If the Edomitiſh circumciſion was the Lords ordinance, then it was a ſeale of Gods couenant to the <hi>Idumeans,</hi> and conſequently the <hi>Edomites</hi> in your iudgement were not Aliens from Gods coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant: for, the ſeale of the couenant, doth import and preſuppoſe a couenant. Beſides, if the Edomitiſh circumciſion was true circumciſion, and the Edo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitiſh Church no Church: then a Sacrament was out of the Church &amp;c. How like you this, M. <hi>Penry?</hi> You knowe my meaning. You adde, that you call not popiſh baptiſme in queſtion. Here, I grant, you doe not: but a little after, you vſe theſe wordes: viz.
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:18219:85"/>where there is no true Chriſt wherunto men can be engraffed by baptiſme, there true baptiſme as tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the ſubſtance cannot be gotten &amp;c. But in po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery there is no true Chriſt &amp;c. <hi>mendacem oportet eſſe memore<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> Your memory is very ſhort. You would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer, I thinke, haue ve<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted ſuch motley ſtuffe as this, if you had thought it would haue bin looked on. I can aſſure you, that beſides me, whom you haue put to a litle paines, your treatiſe hath beene viewed and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiewed by very many learned men, who condemne it for a fooliſh and fantaſticall bable. If the weſt <hi>Indians</hi> after profeſſion of their beliefe in the holy trinitie, were baptized, as you ſay, by popiſh ſhaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, I aſſure my ſelfe that they receiued true bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, &amp; were therfore engraffed into Chriſt. We in the Church of <hi>England</hi> neede not ſaile (thanks be to God) to the maſſemo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gers in <hi>Cuba, Hiſpaniola, Mexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>co,</hi> or any other part of the <hi>Indians,</hi> we haue Gods holy ſeales amongſt vs. If you cal ſuch of the <hi>Indians</hi> as are baptized, heathen, you do them great wrong: for baptiſme is the externall badge of a Chriſtian. I doe not maruaile though you bee bolde with the <hi>Indians,</hi> which are ſo farre off, when you are ſo ſaucy with the principal of the religion in this noble land: I meane our Magiſtrates and learned men, which are ſinguler ornaments of our Church &amp; common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.

                     <p>I might in the third place vſe againſt you <hi>M. Some,</hi> a reaſon of your owne thus concluded. No miniſterie is ſacriledge, becauſe euery miniſterie is an ordinance of God, which cannot bee turned vnto ſacriledge. The popiſh prieſthood is ſacriledge, as you haue ſet downe 21. Therefore the popiſh prieſthoode is no miniſtery, and conſequently popiſh prieſts are no mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. You may ſee that you haue ouerthrowen your owne cauſe. But this maner of reaſoning, although it ſhould be of force agaynſt your ſelfe, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as your owne wordes are brought to expreſſe your owne meaning, yet I account inſufficient.</p>

                     <p>I haue written, I confeſſe, that the Popiſh prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood is ſacriledge. Of this you co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude, that the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh Prieſthood is no Miniſterie, that is, no calling at all: and that I haue ouerthrowen mine owne cauſe. Stay your ſelfe a while good Sir. This victory deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth not ſo much as an oaten ſtraw for the trumpet. I denie your argument: for it is a fallace <hi>à ſecundum quid ad ſimpliciter.</hi> I grau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t that that part of the Popiſh prieſthood which is occupied in ſacrificing, is ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: But that part of the Popiſh prieſthood which is occupied in the adminiſtration of baptiſme is not ſacriledge. For this point I allow <hi>Chemnicius</hi> iudge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. His words are theſe: <hi>Verum quidem est, quia prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalis pars ministerij eſt doctrina: quod ideo quando vera doctrina deprauatur, &amp; prauae opiniones ſtabiliuntur, ipſum miniſterium mutatur, &amp; quod illoru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> miniſterium, qui do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrinam

                     <p>They are no miniſters whoſe very miniſterie ouerthroweth directly the
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:18219:87"/>Prieſthood of our ſauour Chriſt: But the verie miniſtery of popiſh prieſts, directly ouerthroweth the Prieſthoode of Chriſt: therefore they are no miniſters.</p>
                     <p>I knowe not what can be pretended agaynſt the propoſition, vnleſſe men would dreame of a miniſtery, with whom the Prieſthood of the Lorde Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſtand. The latter part of the reaſon is true, if it be true that Chriſt is the only ſacrifice for ſinne, that he is no more to be offered, that by once offering himſelfe, he hath made ful ſatisfaction for the ſinnes of the whole world, and that the popiſh prieſts dayly ſacrifice to appeaſe Gods wrath, for the ſinnes of the quicke and the dead.</p>

                     <p>Before that I anſwere this Argument, I muſt tell you firſt, that euery one of the Religion is perſwaded (as well as you) that Chriſt is the onely ſacrifice for ſinne. Secondly, I muſt tell you, that this argument of yours is very neare of kinne to that which you wil needes borow of me: for it is al one with the laſt. But I muſt beare with you: you haue a ſpeciall gift in va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying a phraſe. For that, you ſhall beare the Bell, and cary the clapper too, if you wil. Is any part, I beſeech you, of the Popiſh prieſthoode, called ſacriledge by any learned Proteſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, but becauſe it is occupied (as the Papiſtes ſay moſt abſurdly) in ſacrificing Chriſt? Nowe I come to your worthy reaſon. I denie your Minor. My reaſon is as before. I reſt in my anſwer to your former argument, which is the ſame with this. Nowe Sir, if I were diſpoſed as you are, I could giue out, that you are neere driuen, when one Argument appeareth (I wil not ſay as you did, is periured) twiſe: and that you are like to them which woulde make men beleeue, there are ſeuerall meates, becauſe one kinde of meate is ſerued in ſeuerall diſhes.</p>

                     <p>Laſtly, they are no Miniſters who are made, that is, called, elected and ordeined by Idolaters. Popiſh prieſts are called, choſen and ordayned by Idolaters: Therefore they are no miniſters.</p>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:18219:87"/>
                     <p>The propoſition appeareth, in that a miniſter can be made by none, but by ſuch as vnto whom the Lord hath giuen leaue to deale in that action, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe the action is fruſtrate. As if a company of women, though religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and godly, ſhould go about to make a miniſter, the action is nothing. Of the aſſumption that popiſh prieſtes are made by Idolaters, I make no queſtion. And when did God giue Idolaters leaue to make miniſters?</p>
                     <p>Seeing therefore that popiſh prieſts are no miniſters, I ſee no ſhewe of probabilitie whereupon my faith, or the faith of any can be aſſured to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceyue true baptiſme at their hands: vnleſſe it can bee ſhewed by you, M. <hi>Some,</hi> that eyther there may bee fayth where there is no promiſe, or that there is a promiſe to receiue a ſacrament where there is no miniſter, which no man of any chriſtian modeſtie will affirme. Hence alſo it followeth, that neither the obſtinate crew of recuſants in this land, who offer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to bee profaned by trayterous and runnagate Ieſuites, nor any elſe within the body of the Romiſh Babylon, can aſſure themſelues that their children receyue the ſubſtance of baptiſme.</p>

                     <p>If by miniſters in your Maior propoſition, you meane lawfull and good miniſters of God, I agree with you. If you meane otherwiſe, I diſſent. If by ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters in your Maior propoſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, you vnderſtand not Pagane but popiſh idolaters: my anſwere is, that ſuch as were called, elected and ordained by them, had a calling though a faultie one. Otherwiſe <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ether, Ridley, Cranmer, Hooper, &amp;c.</hi> had no calling at all. For this point, I referre you to that I haue ſet downe before, <hi>chap. 18.</hi> of this Treatiſe. You aske this queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, viz. When did God giue idolaters leaue to make miniſters? I anſwere: euen then when he gaue the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites leaue to make your ignorant Leuites prieſts: and when hee gaue fooliſh electours of Magiſtrates leaue to chuſe ſuch Magiſtrates as your foele <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daules</hi> was that is, Almightie God gaue no leaue at all. And yet you are reſolute, that the ignorant Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uitical prieſts, which might be wel begged for idiots were lawfull prieſtes, though not good prieſtes: and that ſuch as are choſen Magiſtrates euen againſt the
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:18219:88"/>wooll, haue both the life and birth of Magiſtrates. It pleaſeth you to ſay, that becauſe Popiſh prieſts are no miniſters in your iudgement, that you cannot be aſſured to receiue baptiſme at their hands. Then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, if you were perſwaded (as all learned men are) that Popiſh prieſts haue a calling, you would be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent that infants ſhould be preſented to baptiſme in the Popiſh Church: vvhich Popiſh Church in your iudgement, is no church at all. What I thinke of that particuler, I vvill not preſently vvrite: but this I tell you, that this Argument doeth not neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low: viz. True circumciſion was giuen in <hi>Idumea,</hi> and true baptiſme hath bene &amp; may be giuen of excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated heretiques: therefore, they of <hi>Ieruſalem</hi> in the former times, might require circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the <hi>Edomites,</hi> or they of <hi>Hippo</hi> or <hi>Carthage</hi> in latter times, might require baptiſme amongſt the Donatiſts.</p>

You graunt it to be baptiſme vvhich vvas adminiſtred yeſterday in the Popiſh church: but, you doubt of that vvhich is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered to morow. Then yeſterday a Sacrament, and to morovv none. You dare not for your eares, ſay in flat termes, that it vvas no baptiſme vvhich vvas de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered heretofore in the Popiſh church: for then, many thouſandes vvhoſe Chriſtendome you call in

                     <p>But in popery there is no true Chriſt, whereunto men may be ingraffed, becauſe he is not the true Chriſt, who either will not, or cannot ſatisfie the wrath of God for the ſinnes of the elect, without their merits, and ſuch is the Chriſt profeſſed in popery, and no other.</p>
                     <p>Therefore men cannot be aſſured to haue the ſubſtance of baptiſme in the popiſh Church.</p>

                     <p>I denie your Minor propoſition: for ſuch as were baptized in the Popiſh church, were engraffed by baptiſme into a true Chriſt. The eſſentiall forme of baptiſme was and is retained by the Popiſh prieſtes: viz. <hi>To baptize in the Name of the holy Trinitie.</hi> If your Minor propoſition were true as it is very falſe: then very many in this and other landes which were bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized by Popiſh prieſts in the Popiſh church, are vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptized: for baptiſme is an engraffing into the true Chriſt: and you write that no ſuch engraffing is in the Popiſh church, becauſe no true Chriſt is profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in poperie. If you tell me that you ſpeake not of that which was done yeſterday, but of that which is to morowe, it is a blinde and beggerly ſhift: for the Chriſt profeſſed in poperie, was a deuided Chriſt,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:18219:89"/>when her Maieſtie was baptized, as euen nowe he is in the Popiſh church. That caſe and profeſſion is all one. To proceede, becauſe I will anſwere your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thorowly, I wil ſet it down in this ſort: <hi>The Chriſt profeſsed in Poperie is a deuided Chriſt, and co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſequently not a true Chriſt: therefore none in the Popiſh church are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed by baptiſme into the true Chriſt.</hi> This is your rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon <hi>M. Penry.</hi> My anſwere is, your Antecede<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t is true: I denie your argument. My reaſon is: the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of any man whatſoeuer, ca<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>not ſeparat Chriſt from his owne inſtitution, <hi>Rom. 3:</hi> therefore, ſeeing Chriſts inſtitution is in Popiſh baptiſme, the true Chriſt is there, that is, in that baptiſme. I doe ſet downe my wordes more warily then I needed: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe I finde you to be a meere wrangler, and to take vp that which I neuer let fall. Beſides, circumciſion in <hi>Idumea,</hi> as you write, was true circumciſion and a ſeale of Gods couenant: yet, the <hi>Edomites,</hi> which you cannot denie, failed in the true worſhip of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God.

                     <p>That there is no Church at all in poperie, and that all popiſh prieſts are out of the Church, beſides the former reaſons, this one doth further ſhew. If there be a Church in poperie, or if all popiſh prieſts bee not out of the Church, then thoſe magiſtrates that haue ſeparated themſelues and their ſubiects (and all others that made this ſeparation) from the Romiſh re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as from that ſynagogue where ſaluation is not to be had, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, where there is no Church, are ſchiſmatikes, to ſpeake the leaſt. Becauſe it is a ſchiſme to make this ſeparation from the Church, deteſt the corruptions thereof we may, but make ſuch a ſeparation from the Church, we ought not vnleſſe we would be accounted ſchiſmatiks. But thoſe Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates and their people, that made this ſeparation, are not ſchiſmatickes, becauſe in Poperie the foundation is ouerthrowen. You ſay in your booke

                        <hi>(M. Some)</hi> page 33. that you could preſſe the Argument of the Magiſtracie againſt me very farre. Whether you may or no, that ſhal be co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſidered when I deale with the point: but this I am aſſured of, that in this point, you ſhall be driuen either to defend the abſurditie, that baptiſme is to be had out of the Church in a companie eſtranged from Chriſt, which I thinke you will not do, or vrged ſo farre, as to the plaine breach of a Statute (which farre be it from me) euen in the cauſe of treaſon. Will ye ſay that baptiſme may be had out of the Church? the aſſertion is abſurd: Or will you hold that there is a Church in Poperie? the aſſertion is dangerous, and I haue prooued it falſe. It is dangerous, becauſe it affirmeth our Magiſtrates to be ſchiſma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiks, inaſmuch as they haue ſeparated themſelues from the Church: I hope rather then you will fall into either of theſe points, that you will graunt me the cauſe.</p>

                     <p>I will anſwere your ſeuerall pointes very briefly. The reaſon which you vſe to prooue there is no Church at all in popery, is this, viz. If there bee a Church at al in popery, the Magiſtrates and people which are of the religion are ſchiſmaticks at the leaſt. My anſwere is, that this is a popiſh argument. I haue anſwered it before, and doe reſt in that an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere. If either you or any of the popiſh ſort miſlike my anſwere, you may confute it. Beſides, if there be no Church at all in popery, as you affirme, why ſhould the Churches of <hi>England, Germany, De<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>marke,</hi> (which were ſometimes popiſh) be called <hi>reformed Churches?</hi> The very name of <hi>reformed Churches</hi> doth manifeſtly import, that the Churches of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Germanie, Denmarke,</hi> &amp;c. (though popiſh and vnſound) were Churches in ſome ſort, before the reformation. If you thinke that all the popiſh ſorte which died in the popiſh Church ore damned, you thinke abſurdly: for you diſſent from the iudgement of all the learned proteſtants, and doe preſume to ſit in Gods chaire, which is intollerable ſawcineſſe. To ſay, or write, that true baptiſme hath beene, and may bee out of the Church, is a true propoſition
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:18219:90"/>in diuinitie. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> did maintaine it againſt the Donatiſts. The moſt famous me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> &amp; Churches in our time, are of that iudgement. I reſt in that with all my heart. You account it an abſurde propoſition. The beſt is, you are not maſter of the ſentences, as <hi>Peter Lumbard</hi> was. If you were (which God defend) the ſounde diuinity which is taught in <hi>Cambridge</hi> and <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſhould bee cryed downe, and your ſtrange fancies ſhould be ruled caſes. The argument of the magiſtracy is touched before. I perceiue it hath mooued you a litle: for you drawe out a ſtatute of Treaſo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, &amp;c. What, I beſeech you good Sir? No leſſe then Treaſon? you are a charitable man. I haue, do, and will perfourme all dutie, by Gods grace, to the religion and my gracious Prince, ſo long as I liue: therefore treaſon ſtatutes can take no hold of mee. Yea, the refutation of your blaſphemous, Anabap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſticall, popiſh, and proude errours by me, is, I am ſure, a performance of a ſpeciall duetie to Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, my Prince, and this Church. And, I doubt not, but that bleſſing which God hath giuen alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to my laſt treatiſe, and which his Maieſtie will giue to this, will marre your market. Great wordes ſhal not fray me, &amp;c. If your ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t diſciples wil ſtil magnifie you, it ſhal not be ſtra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge to me: they do but their kind.

If you will haue any thing at my hands in diuinitie matters, you muſt gaine it by force of argument. If you thinke that I will come off otherwiſe, you are in a wrong boxe: for I intend not to be at your whiſtle. Yea, I require and charge you in the name of God (if you be not voyde of grace) to confeſſe your ignorance, to deteſt your errours, to yeeld vnto Gods truth, that Gods bleſſing may reſt vpon you.

                     <p>Laſtly, if men might be aſſured that they could haue the true ſubſtance of baptiſme in Popery, then they ought not to keepe their children from Popiſh baptiſme, if there were no other baptiſme in the worlde to be had. For men might come to their baptiſme &amp; deteſt their corruptions, if it be Gods baptiſme, as you <hi>M. Some</hi> affirmed it to be, pag. 20. And they can adde an edifying worde vnto the Sacrament: if the recitall of the wordes of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution be an edifying word, and that be ſufficient to make a Sacrament, both which you haue written, page 23. 24. But men ought rather to keepe their children vnbaptized, then to offer them to bee prophaned by Popiſh baptiſme, both for the former reaſons, and becauſe wee ought to haue no more fellowſhip with Papiſts in the ſeruice of God, then with Pagane ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laters. <hi>M.

                     <p>I vvill anſvvere this ſection of yours both briefly and roundly by the grace of God. That baptiſme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered in the Popiſh church, was and is Gods bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, I make no queſtion. For proofe of this point, I haue ſet downe waightie reaſons in my former trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe: One of <hi>M. Caluines,</hi> an other <hi>ab Abſurdo.</hi> Your an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſweres to them are very fooliſh, and are ſo accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:18219:92"/>of by the learned ſort. I haue examined them a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in this Treatiſe. It is the iudgement of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, that there was &amp; is true baptiſme in the Popiſh church. Before, you denied it not: but now, the caſe is altered: you accompt it an errour to affirme it. What mutabilitie is this? Hee that would ſaile after your compaſſe for Diuinitie matters, ſhould proue as giddie as a gooſe. I pray God with all my heart to bleſſe his people in <hi>England</hi> &amp; <hi>Wales,</hi> and to keepe them from ſuch blinde guides as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort are, and from ſuch blinde guides as the ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant ſort are, and from ſuch ſhameleſſe and fanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall guides as you, <hi>M. Penry,</hi> are. Concerning this queſtion, viz. whether men ought to offer their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren to Popiſh baptiſme, if there were no other bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme in the world to be had: <hi>M. Penry</hi> ſaith one while that they ought, if Popiſh baptiſme be Gods Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme: which before he denied not. An other while, he is peremptory that me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> ought rather to kepe their childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnbaptized. His reaſon is: becauſe we ought to haue no more fellowſhip with papiſts in Gods ſcruice, then with pagane Idolaters. The iſſue there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore nowe is: firſt, whether infants ought rather to be kept vnbaptized, then to bee preſented to popiſh baptiſme. Secondly, whether no more fellowſhip is to be had with papiſts in Gods ſeruice, then with heathen Idolaters. Concerning the firſt queſtion, M. <hi>Caluines</hi> reſolution is affirmatiue, if the parents (which they cannot do without peril of life) do pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely deteſt the popiſh corruptions. M. <hi>Caluines</hi> rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon is: the omitting of baptiſme is contempt of Chriſtianitie. <hi>Cal. Epiſt. 104.</hi> Of this iudgement are <hi>Melanchthon</hi> and <hi>Peter Martyr. Cal. Epiſt. 103.</hi> &amp; <hi>Vire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus Tract: de commun: fid. cum papiſt.

                        <pb n="181" facs="tcp:18219:92"/>I confeſſe freely, that this is a very waightie queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on (but in this our time a needeleſſe queſtion) and that men of great excelle<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>cie for learning, haue their ſeueral iudgements. I would be loath to ſtirre coales in this argument. Touching the other queſtion, M. <hi>Penry</hi> ſaith that no more fellowſhip is to be had in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion matters with papiſts then with pagane Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I diſſent from him in this. My reaſons are: firſt, the papiſts profeſſe the holy Trinitie: ſo doe not the pagane Idolaters. Secondly, the papiſts are not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether aliens from Gods external couenant: but the heathen Idolaters as yet are. Laſtly, M. <hi>Caluine</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flat againſt you in this point. <hi>Epiſt. 104.</hi> In ſteed of anſwering his reaſons in that Epiſtle, you appeale to the word. A ſtrange kind of appealing, whe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> M. <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines</hi> arguments are drawen out of the holy word. If you wil deale plainly as you ought, neuer piddle any longer: goe through ſtitch withall: ſeeing you are ouer ſhoes, aduenture ouer bootes too: confute <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uines 104.

Such are M. <hi>Penries</hi> ignorant Leuiticall prieſts, whom he warranteth (notwithſtanding their extreeme igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance) to be lawfull prieſts, though not good prieſts.

That ſuch ignorant
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:18219:93"/>men ought to bee thruſt out of the holy miniſterie, and ſent to ſome occupation, is a cleare and ruled caſe in Gods booke. I haue handled this argument before: I reſt in that which I haue written there.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>They are affirmed to bee no Miniſters, not becauſe they are euill mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, but becauſe their Miniſterie is an euil and profane miniſterie: So that in this point the fault is not found with the euill miniſter, but with the euill miniſterie. Their miniſterie is prophane and euill, becauſe there is no mention made of it in the worde. And a miniſtery not mentioned in the worde is no miniſtery, but a prophane conſtitution. For the Lord hath ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſet downe euery miniſtery of the newe Teſtament, that ſhould be in the Church vnto the worlds ende: Whereas he hath not once mentioned the Miniſterie of our Readers, becauſe it is not a preaching Miniſtery.

                     <p>My anſwere ſhall be ſo briefe as may be. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I diſſent, I will giue my reaſons. If the miniſterie (as you ſay) of vnpreaching miniſters be an euil and profane miniſterie, it is a good conſequent, that vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching miniſters, are euill and profane miniſters. The argument foloweth <hi>à coniugatis.</hi> To proceede: you write, that the miniſterie of ignorant miniſters, is not mentioned in the word<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therefore it is no mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterie (in your iudgement) but a profane conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I am ſure you thinke this argument to be a ſure
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:18219:94"/>one, but you are fowly deceyued. I deny your ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent. My reaſon is: By <hi>Miniſterie</hi> in your antece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, I vnderſtand <hi>the reading of the holy Scriptures, the deliuering of the publikee prayers, the adminiſtration of the Sacraments:</hi> all which are the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſtitution of Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, therefore no profane conſtitution, as you verie profanely doe imagine. He that miſliketh the reading of the holy Scriptures, is a <hi>Zwing fildian</hi> he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike. He that miſliketh the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, is a <hi>Meſſalian</hi> heretike. He that miſly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the inuocation of our gracious God, is a filthie <hi>Atheiſt,</hi> that is, of no religion. If you tell me, that you thinke excellently of the adminiſtration of the Sacraments, publique prayers, &amp;c. But that your meaning is, that it is not Gods pleaſure, that igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant men ſhoulde adminiſter ſuch precious iewels, I aſſent vnto you: but, I muſt adde this, that as you and I doe miſlike the entrance of vnfit men into, and the continuance of them in the holy miniſterie, ſo neither of vs can iuſtly miſlike their miniſterie, that is, the reading of the holy Scriptures, &amp;c. Nowe I come to your propoſitions, which you call <hi>Axiomes.</hi> The firſt is this: viz. <hi>Euery ministerie is expreſſely ſet downe in the worde.</hi> I graunt that the ſubſtance of eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry miniſterie is expreſly ſet downe in the holy word. By <hi>Miniſterie,</hi> I vnderſtand not onely the miniſterie of the word &amp; Sacraments (as you doe in this place) but that miniſterie which concerneth the reliefe of the poore, and the ciuill gouernement. For the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate is the miniſter of God. <hi>Rom. 13.</hi> If <hi>Magiſtracie</hi> is Gods miniſterie, and the ſubſtance of it expreſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſet downe in Gods booke, it is a good conſequent that <hi>Magistracie</hi> is not a deuice of man, but an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:18219:94"/>conſtitution, preſcribed in the worde. Your ſecond <hi>Axiome</hi> is this: viz. <hi>Euerie ministerie of the newe Teſtament is a preaching miniſterie.</hi> If you meane (as I thinke you doe) euery miniſterie of the worde in the new Teſtament, I diſſent not from you. Nowe ſir, to come a litle neerer you, I muſt tell you that which either you knowe not, or diſſemble, viz. that the lawes of this lande doe barre ignorant men from entring into the holy miniſterie: they are flat againſt it. I offer you a branch of an Act of Parliame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t to be conſidered of. The wordes of the Act are theſe: viz. <hi>That none ſhall be made miniſter or admitted to preach or miniſter the Sacraments, being vnder the age of 24. yeeres, nor vnleſſe he firſt bring to the Biſhop of that Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe from men knowen to the Biſhop to be of ſound religion, a teſtimoniall both of his honest life, and of his profeſsing the doctrine expreſſed in the ſaid Articles: nor, vnleſſe he bee able to anſwere and render to the Ordinarie an accompt of his faith in Latine, according to the ſaid Articles: or, haue ſpeciall gift and habilitie to bee a preacher: nor ſhall bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the order of Deacon or miniſterie, vnleſſe he ſhall first ſubſcribe to the ſaid Articles. Anno. 13. Reg. Elizab. cap. 12.</hi> You ſee by this, that the lawe of the lande re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth in him which is to be admitted to the holy miniſterie, ſoundneſſe in religion, gifts in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and honeſtie of life. They muſt to together. Learning without godlineſſe, is as a gold ring vpon a ſwines ſnoute. Godlineſſe in a miniſter, without learning, is, as a faire colour without light to ſhew it by, and as a goodly bell without a clapper. Your third <hi>Axoime</hi> is this: viz. <hi>The miniſterie of our vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ministers, is not a preaching miniſterie.</hi> No man doubteth of this, vnleſſe he bee voyde of common
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:18219:95"/>ſenſe. Thus you haue my reſolution briefly for theſe poynts: and yet you are no conquerour, as <hi>Caeſar</hi> was, nor I ouerthrowen, as <hi>Pompey</hi> was. If your arguments were as tidie, as your ſpeeches are confident, there were no dealing with you. I perceiue the greateſt barkers are not the ſoreſt biters. Anſwere me I pray you directly to theſe queſtions. Doe you thinke, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe our vnpreaching miniſters are not preaching miniſters, that no ſacraments either were or are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by them? Before, you denie it not. If you ſhould, neither ſacrifices nor ſacraments were offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red or adminiſtred by your ignora<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t Leuitical prieſts: for they were vnpreaching miniſters. Do you thinke that al ſuch are polluted, which receiue a Sacrament at the handes of vnpreaching miniſters? If you doe, then was Saint <hi>Paul</hi> polluted which communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated with your ignorant Leuites: for they were vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preaching miniſters. Thus you ſee, to what ſtreights you are driuen.</p>

You write, that if no preaching had bene, no Church had bene. If you meane that no Church had ordinarily bene without preaching, that is, that preaching is the ordinarie means for the beginning and growth of the Church, I aſſent vnto you: but I adde this, that it hath and doeth pleaſe God, by the reading of the holy Scriptures and the working of his Spirit, to renue the hearts of many.

                     <p>My 2. and 3. reaſons are drawen out of theſe wordes of Paul, Rom. 12.6 7.8. Seeing then that we haue giftes that are diuers, according to the grace that is giuen vnto vs: whether we haue prophecie, let vs prophecie, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the proportion of faith: or an office, let vs waite on the office: or he that teacheth on teaching, or he that exhorteth on exhorting, &amp;c. The 2. reaſon is thus concluded.</p>
                     <p>Whoſoeuer hath receiued a miniſtery, and ſo a paſtorall or doctorall function, hee hath receiued prophecie ſpoken of in this place, verſe 6. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe euery paſtoral or doctorall function, mentioned in the 7. and 8. verſe, vnder theſe words, he that teacheth, hee that exhorteth: are conteined vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the word prophecie, verſ. 6. Inſomuch as he that hath not receiued that prophecie there ſet downe, wherby is ment the interpretation of the word:
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:18219:96"/>he hath not receiued the paſtorall or doctoral function ſet downe verſ. 7.8 But vnpreaching miniſters haue not receiued the prophecie ſpoken of in this place, which is expreſly ſet downe, verſe 6. to be one of the diuers gifts beſtowed for the gouernment of the body, which is the Church. Therefore alſo, they haue receiued neither a paſtoral nor a doctorall function, and ſo no preaching miniſtery.</p>

                     <p>Your drifte is as before, to proue that our ignorant miniſters are vnfurniſhed, therefore no preachers. You ſay true. Will you conclude of this, that they haue no miniſterie at all, &amp; that the actions of their miniſtery, viz. the adminiſtration of the ſacraments, the reading of the holy ſcriptures, &amp;c. are not profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table in any ſort to the godly aſſe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>bly? If you diſpute thus, I deny your argument, and do giue this reaſon. An abſurde Magiſtrate is not furniſhed by almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie God, and therefore vtterly vnfit to be Gods lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant: but we may not inferre of this, that the actes done by him in his magiſtracie are not the actes of a Magiſtrate. If you tell me that the arguments for vnfit magiſtrates &amp; miniſters are of ſeuerall ſtamps, I graunt you ſay ſo. So did, when time was, an other groſſe Anabaptiſt: but all learned men agree with me, and diſſent from you.</p>

                     <p n="3">3 No miniſtery is ſeparated from a gift, becauſe prophecie ſpoken of in this 6. verſe, vnder which as we ſee, euery paſtorall and doctorall miniſtery is conteined, cannot bee ſeuered from a gift: but the miniſtery of our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders is ſeuered in them from a gift: therefore in them it is no miniſtery.</p>
                     <p>It is no miniſtery in them I ſay, although that miniſtery, the generall name whereof they haue, is not ſeuered from a gift in preaching miniſters: But what is that to them? what is the miniſtery of other men vnto them? they are not miniſters, by the miniſtery wherewith other men are endued, but by their owne, which being ſeuered from a gift, is no miniſtery. Paul had bin no Apoſtle, &amp; had receiued no Apoſtleſhip, vnleſſe he could haue ſayd, I am a miniſter according vnto the grace giuen vnto mee, <hi>Ephe.</hi> 3.7. and not according to the grace giuen vnto other Apoſtles, the generall name of whoſe Apoſtleſhip I am entituled with. A ridiculous ſpeache it
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:18219:96"/>were to ſay, mine apoſtleſhip hath receiued grace, but I that am the apoſtle haue receiued none.</p>
                     <p>Howe then may our readers claime a preaching miniſtery vnto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues, ſeeing the miniſtery which they challenge, is altogether in them without a gift, though it be not ſo in others?</p>

                     <p>I graunt that no lawfull and good Miniſter of God wants furniture of gifts. If you will conclude of this, that the approbation of the Church is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing if ſufficie<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t parts be wanting in them which are admitted to the miniſterie, I denie your argument, and doe offer you for my reaſon a floure of your owne garden: euen that which you haue written be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in theſe wordes, viz. that <hi>vnfitneſſe to teach made not a nullitie of the Leuitical prieſts office.</hi> If you anſwere that extreeme ignorance in the Leuiticall prieſtes, did neither barre them from, nor ſtrippe them of the Leuiticall prieſthood: I replie that this is a poſitiue and perpetual law of almightie God for the prieſtes then, &amp; for the Miniſters now, viz. <hi>The prieſts lips ſhall keepe knowledge. Mal. 2.</hi> yea, M. <hi>Caluine</hi> a famous lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man writeth vpon that place of <hi>Malachie,</hi> that <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerdos &amp; doctor ſunt termini conuertibiles,</hi> that is, that Gods prieſt &amp; a teacher are ſo neere of kinne, that they are like to <hi>Hippocrates</hi> twinnes, which laughed together and wept together, which liued together and died together. You adde that the miniſterie in preaching miniſters is not ſeuered from a gift: but that the vnpreaching miniſter is not enriched by the furniture of another mans gifts. A deepe matter forſooth. It is as cleare as the Sunne, that learned miniſters haue furniture of gifts, &amp; that ignorant men are not learned becauſe the other are ſo. Blind <hi>Bartimeus</hi> could haue eſpied this. Do you thinke that
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:18219:97"/>any man of any accompt for learning will rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon thus? Diuers learned men haue written excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently, therefore M. <hi>Penry</hi> hath ſo, which hath bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched many palpable errours. If any ſhould diſpute thus, he ſhould reaſon abſurdly: and yet it is a wiſe a ſpeech as that which was deliuered euen nowe by your ſelfe. You write that it were a ridiculous ſpeach to ſay, Mine Apoſtleſhip hath receiued grace, but I that am the Apoſtle, haue receiued none. I confeſſe that Gods graces are not tied to any chaire. To thinke otherwiſe, is a popiſh fancie. But I dare tell you this, which I am ſure is good diuinitie, that ſome actions of ignorant &amp; euill miniſters may haue good grace at Gods hands, when the parties themſelues find none. I prooue it thus. Firſt, the ſacrifices of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant Leuiticall prieſtes were profitable to many godly men in that time, but not to thoſe prieſts. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, publique prayers deliuered by abſurd mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in the name of the godly aſſembly, are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to the aſſembly, but not to them: for the prayers are accepted by almightie God, <hi>Non proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſitate praepoſitorum, ſed pro deuotione populorum,</hi> that is, Not for the peruerſeneſſe of the miniſters, but for the deuotion of the people. <hi>Augu. contra epiſt.

                     <p>Euery vnpreaching miniſter ſinneth in executing the workes of a paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall function, as the Sacraments, &amp;c. therefore he hath no miniſtery, and ſo neither a paſtorall nor doctorall function. He hath no miniſtery, becauſe his calling is not the calling of the miniſtery. His calling is not the calling of the miniſtery, becauſe he ſinneth in intermedling with the works there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. And this is an infallible trueth, that no man ſinneth becauſe he dealeth with the workes of his calling. For this is the duetie that God requireth at the hands of euery man. Many ſinne in deede becauſe they walke corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their callings, and haue no care to glorifie God therein, Col. 3.17. But leaue thy corruption and thou ſinneſt not, in keeping thee to the workes of
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:18219:97"/>thy calling. The hypocrites in the dayes of Iſaiah 1.13. ſinned not becauſe they offered ſacrifice, but becauſe they did the ſame through hypocriſie. Their hypocriſie they ought to haue left, but not his ſeruice in ſacrificing according to his commandement: but our readers though they ſhould with as litle corruption, and as great zeale to Gods glory and the good of his Church as any men, deale in the workes of a paſtorall miniſtery, yet they ſhould ſtill doe that which the Lord had forbidden them to doe, whence it appeareth, that the workes of the miniſtery are not the workes of their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling. For God forbiddeth no man to deale therewith, and not being the workes of their calling, they are no miniſters, and haue neyther paſtorall nor doctorall function.</p>

                     <p>You would fayne prooue that vnpreaching mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue no miniſterie at all: but it will not be. You haue euill lucke. you cannot hitte that marke. Your reaſon is this: <hi>Euerie vnpreaching minister ſinneth in executing the workes of a paſtorall function, as the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments &amp;c. therefore he hath no ministerie &amp;c.</hi> Mine an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwere is, that I deny your argument. My reaſon is: The ſonnes of <hi>Heli</hi> ſinned in the execution of their miniſtery, <hi>1. Sam. 2.</hi> yet they were miniſters. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious miniſters of <hi>Philippi</hi> ſinned in the executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their miniſterie, <hi>Philippi. 1.</hi> yet they were mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters. You go on M. <hi>Penry</hi> in this ſort: The Lord, you ſay, hath forbidden ignorant men to deale with the workes of the miniſterie, therefore ignorant mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters haue no miniſterie at all. Your Antecedent is true: for the holy miniſterie is too high a calling for ſuch baſe companions. Your argument is very falſe. My reaſon is: your ignorant Leuites were forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den by almightie God to enter into the prieſthood: yet they were lawfull prieſts in your iudgement, becauſe they were of the line of <hi>Aaron</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>This is further ſhewed, foraſmuch as the Lord doeth not commit vnto bare readers the charge of thoſe ſoules, ouer whom they are, which he doeth vnto euery one that hath a paſtorall function, Acts. 20.26.28. 1. theſ.
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:18219:98"/>5.12. Heb. 13.17. For to what ende elſe, ſhould he commit a miniſterie vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any, who haue ſoules vnder their charge? The Church in deede may commit the ſoules of men vnto readers, but certainely the Lord commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth none vnto them. And he is no miniſter, vnto whom the Lord doeth not commit this charge, as the places before quoted doe ſhewe. For the Lord hath in his word, ordeined not onely offices, the executours where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſhould haue the ouerſight of ſoules, but alſo the perſons who were to execute thoſe functions, 1. Cor. 12.28. 1. Pet. 4.10. Rom. 12.6.7.8. Epheſ. 4.7.11. Nowe vnpreaching miniſters are none of thoſe perſons, becauſe the Lord knoweth them not to be able to feede ſoules. And let not men be ſo iniurious vnto the Lord, as to affirme, that he according vnto his reuea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ordinance (for thereof I ſpeake as of a miniſterie, and not of his ſecret iudgements) bequeathed the ſoules of men to be ſtarued and kept from ſaluation. As he muſt needs be conuinced, to do if he bequeathed the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vnto thoſe men, the diſpenſatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of whoſe miniſterie is able to beget none, feede none, ſaue none. You muſt vnderſtand againe, that I ſpeake of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie whereby readers are miniſters, that is, of their owne, and not of the miniſterie whereby preaching miniſters are miniſters, wherewith readers haue nothing to doe.</p>

                     <p>That almightie God neuer committed charge of ſoules to ignorant men (vnleſſe it were to puniſh them, as he did the rebellious Iſraelites by ignorant Leuiticall prieſtes) is a cleare trueth in diuinitie: I a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree with you in that. You ſay that the diſpenſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our readers miniſterie doth feede none. In that you erre groſſely. My reaſon is: The Sacraments ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred by them doe comfort and feede the ſoules of the godly communicants: for the vertue of the Sacrament dependeth not of any miniſter whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer &amp;c.

Is man to be anſwerable vnto the Lord of that which he neuer receiued? doeth the Lord require the vſe of that ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent which he neuer beſtowed? doth he lay that vpon any, whereof he may haue iuſt cauſe to complaine? When did he impoſe a charge vpon any, vnto whom he gaue not gifts to diſcharge the ſame? nowe the charge of ſoules which he committeth vnto any, he requireth at their hands vnto whom he hath committed it, which he could not doe, if he had not giuen abilitie to the diſcharge thereof.</p>

If his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ieſtie (which is farre from him) either had or did commit the charge of ſoules to ſuch as haue no met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall in them, hee might be iuſtly conuinced of, and chale<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ged for iniuirious dealing with them. No good Captaine will ſend his ſouldier naked into the fielde againſt an armed enemie.

                     <p>The pretence that the Lord committeth the charge of ſoules vnto their miniſterie, and not vnto them, is firſt a deſiring of that in queſtion: (for they are denied to haue any miniſterie) and otherwiſe many wayes vnſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient. 1 Becauſe the Lord committeth not the charge of ſoules there, where the puniſhment of their deſtruction cannot take holde, as it can not vpon the miniſterie: 2 the miniſterie is but a dead thing of it ſelfe, moſt beautifull in deede, as being an ordinance of the Lorde, but able to ſaue none, vnleſſe it be committed vnto a perſon, who in the execution thereof, is able to ſhewe himſelfe to be appointed of God for that glorious worke. This is taught Epheſ. 4. where the Apoſtle verſes 6. and 7. hauing ſpoken of the giftes beſtowed vpon men for this miniſteriall worke, aſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beth verſ. 11.12. the gathering together of the Saints, not vnto the giftes or functions, but vnto men endued with the ſaid gifts. For he doth not ſay that the Lord hath appointed for the gathering together of the Saints, an apoſtleſhip, a paſtorall or doctorall function, &amp;c. but that he ordained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, paſtors, &amp;c. for that end and purpoſe: whereunto becauſe our rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders were not appointed, it forcibly enſueth, that they haue no miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie, no paſtorall or doctorall function, and ſo are no miniſters: which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion alſo in the laſt edition of mine exhortation vnto my countrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, I haue enforced by many ſtrong, and as I am aſſured inuincible rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, drawen out of the infallible trueth of Gods worde.</p>

                     <p>What other men doe or will pretende, I cannot tell. I am fully perſwaded, that Almightie God did neuer commit his ſheepe, ſouldiers, citie, to fooliſh ſhepheards, vnskilfull captaines, blinde watchmen. Such ſhepheards, captaines, watchmen, were your ignorant Leuiticall Prieſts, whoſe entrance and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance in the prieſthoode, are condemned by the written worde. The line of <hi>Aaron</hi> was not ſtrong y<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to breake the cords of Almightie God. Such
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:18219:100"/>ſhepheards, captaines, watchmen, are our ignorant miniſters. Let the ignorant Leuites and miniſters be matched together, good <hi>M. Penry.</hi> They muſt needes ſaile in one ſhippe, fight vnder one banner, and bee condemned at one barre: and yet I graunt, that your ignorant Leuites which were neuer called of God, but of the Iewiſh Church, did offer and deliuer the Legal Sacrifices and Sacraments: and that the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Communicants were not polluted by their igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. You muſt of force graunt me thus much for vnpreaching miniſters: for you haue not before de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied it. So ſhall ſome queſtions betweene you and me be decided, and you ſhall agree with all the lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Proteſtants and reformed Churches. You write that the Apoſtle doth not ſay that the Lord hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the gathering together of the Saintes, an Apoſtleſhip, a paſtorall or doctorall function, but that he ordeined apoſtles, paſtors, &amp;c. You write ſtrangely in my iudgement. If God appointed Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, he appointed the Apoſtleſhip: if paſtors, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a paſtorall function: for they cannot be ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled. Euery meane Logician, yea euery ſenſible man conceiueth this.</p>

For you ſhall but ſtriue in vaine againſt the concluſion, as long as the premiſſes, whereby it is inferred, remaine firme.

                     <p>I haue now anſwered your whole booke. I haue and doe ſubmit my labour to the iudgement of the learned, therefore not of you or your ignorant diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples. Becauſe you will haue mee haue a little more
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:18219:100"/>worke, you in treate mee to anſwere foure reaſons in your <hi>Addition.</hi> If you had not bene very lordly, you would haue ſet downe the reaſons you ſelfe: but, whatſoeuer you doe, becommeth you. You may commaund, comptroll, and deale with others, as <hi>Strato</hi> did, which was a king ouer beaſts. At the leaſt, you thinke ſo, whatſoeuer other men doe. Well, I am content to ſatisfie your deſire: for, as good happe is, I haue your booke by me: and it is a fault <hi>in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo actu deficere,</hi> that is, to reſemble the ſlouthful poet in the winding vp of the clewe. Your firſt reaſon is conteined in theſe wordes: viz. Euery one that hath the life of a miniſter good or bad (or that is a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter in deede) is ordayned of God for the gathering together of the Saints: For, there is no other mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ſpoken of in the worde. No bare reader is ordei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of God for this ende: Therefore no bare reader is a miniſter in deede, or hath the life of a miniſter, good or bad. In <hi>Add. pag. 52.</hi> I anſwere briefly, that ſome parts of your Maior propoſition are without ſenſe. You write that euery one which hath the life of a bad miniſter is ordained of God for the gathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring together of the Saints. In this ſhort ſpeech of yours, there are groſſe errors. The firſt errour is, that bad miniſters are ordeined of God for the gathering together of the Saints. It is a certaine truth in Gods booke, that ſuch as are called by the Lord to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent worke, are not bad miniſters, as you verie baſely do imagine, but choiſe men for gifts and life, &amp;c. <hi>1. Tim. 3.</hi> Your ſecond errour, is this: viz. That furniture of gifts is one part of the life of a bad mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. This is ſtrange diuinitie. My reaſon is: furniture of gifts is one part of the life of a good miniſter: ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:18219:101"/>want of giftes is one branch of the life of a bad miniſter. The Antecedent is manifeſt: the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſtrong: <hi>ſecundùm legem oppoſitionis,</hi> as the Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians tearme it. I haue told you often, that furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of giftes is of the eſſence of a lawfull and good miniſter of God, but not of the eſſence of a miniſter ſimply. This I reſt in: ſo muſt you whether you will or no, vnleſſe you will crie downe your ignorant Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites, and holde this for a principle, that no Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, either was or is adminiſtred by vnpreaching miniſters. Your three other reaſons, are all one, and may be ſhut vp in this ſhort argument: viz. <hi>Vnprea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching miniſters are not able to feede the elect with the food of knowledge and vnderſtanding: therefore they haue no calling at all, howſoeuer they haue the Churches approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, &amp;c. In Add. pag. 55.57.</hi> I denie your argument, and haue ſet downe reaſons for it before, in this Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe. It is time now to take <hi>manum de tabula,</hi> that is, to ceaſe this courſe. My comfort is, that I haue the conſent of all the learned, and that Almightie God wil bleſſe this labour.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Law is a yoke, which neither the holy Fathers, nor the Apoſtles, &amp;c. were able to beare. So ſaith the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in that famous Councill holden at <hi>Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem:</hi> his words are theſe, <hi>Why tempt ye God, to lay a yoke on the diſciples neckes, which neither our Fathers, nor wee were able to beare, &amp;c. Acts. chap.</hi> 15. <hi>verſe</hi> 10.11. <hi>S. Peter</hi> ſpeaketh expreſly of ſuch as were regenerate.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 It was impoſſible to the Lawe (to take away ſinne and death) in as much as it was weake becauſe of the fleſh. So writeth S. <hi>Paul Rom.</hi> 8. there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the weakeneſſe of fleſh is ſuch euen in the regenerate, that they are not able to fulfill the Lawe. <hi>Iex iubet, non iuuat: ostendit peccatum, non tollit:</hi> that is, the Lawe doth commaund, but not helpe: the Lawe doth ſhewe ſinne, but it doth not take away ſinne.</p>
                  <p n="3">3 The regenerate are guiltie of the breach of ſome one commaunde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: therefore they doe not fulfill the Lawe.</p>
                  <p>The antecedent is manifeſt, for the regenerate doe ſinne, 1. Iohn 1.8. Matth. 6.12. <hi>Non peccare, Dei iustitia:</hi> that is, not to ſinne is Gods righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe &amp;c. and ſinne is a tranſgreſſion of the Lawe, 1. Iohn 3 I proue my argument thus: <hi>He that faileth in one (commaundement) is guiltie of all. Iames</hi> 2.10. The reaſon of that is, Firſt, becauſe he hath violated the maieſtie of the Lawgiuer which is one and the ſame: Secondly, becauſe the body of Gods Lawe is <hi>indiuiduum,</hi> that is, cannot be parted.</p>
                  <p n="4">4 The workes of the regenerate, are vnperfite. <hi>Aaron</hi> which was the high Prieſt, in the time of the Lawe, and a figure of Chriſt, was appointed by Almightie God, to beare the iniquitie of the holy offrings, <hi>Exod. Chap.</hi> 28. <hi>verſe</hi> 38. <hi>S. Paul</hi> after his conuerſion, was farre from perfection, <hi>Phil. Chap.</hi> 3.

Chap.</hi> 4.</p>
                  <p n="5">5 The regenerate cannot loue God &amp; their neighbour perfectly, as the Lawe of God requireth: for they offend God and their neighbour, either in worde, deede, or concupiſcence, therefore, &amp;c. <hi>The Law is ſpirituall, Rom.

                  <p>It is confeſſed both by proteſtants and papiſts, that wee are iuſtified by <hi>Grace.</hi> The difference betweene vs is in this.

The papiſts by this word <hi>(Grace)</hi> vnderſtand a quality powred into our hearts by Almightie God: by reaſon of which qualitie we liue holily and are iuſtified (as they ſay) in Gods ſight. This is the <hi>Inherent righteouſneſse</hi> which the papiſts doe write and ſpeake ſo much of. Wee which are the proteſtants, do confeſſe, that that righteouſneſſe, which is an effect of Gods ſanctifying ſpirit, and the fruite of our iuſtification before God, is inherent in vs: likewiſe the firſt fruits of our glorification, that is, peace of conſcience &amp; ioy in the holy Ghoſt. That righteouſneſſe wherby we are accompted iuſt, or are iuſtified, or are made iuſt before God, is not inherent in vs, my reaſon is: we are made righteous by Chriſts obedience. <hi>Rom. chap.</hi> 5. <hi>verſ.</hi> 19. which obedience of Chriſt, is not within, but without vs: and yet this obedience of Chriſt, is apprehended by a iuſtifying faith, as almes is by the hand of a poore man. Perfite righteouſnes ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herent in vs, if we could keepe all Gods commaundements as exactly, as Almightie God requireth. The beſt men were and are ſhort in that. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly our Lord and ſauiour Ieſus Chriſt, which was free from ſinne, did fulfill the lawe as God requireth.</p>
